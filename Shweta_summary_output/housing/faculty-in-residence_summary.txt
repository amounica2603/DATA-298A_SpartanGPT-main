The university's faculty in residence program consists of two full-time faculty members who live in student housing and work with the professors to support their students' academic success. They also provide mentorship for student residents, as well as other services such as social and cultural events and activities. This position is offered for the 23-25 academic year. It is an opportunity for students to be connected with their professors outside the classroom. In addition, it provides them with opportunities to engage in community life and develop relationships with other students. As a result of this position, students will have the opportunity to become more involved in their studies and to make connections with other professors.
	Dr. Wiggins, a student at the university, has been accepted into the Office of Minority Health, Transportation, and Education as well as the National Science Foundation. She's looking forward to building relationships with students and helping them find their way in college.
