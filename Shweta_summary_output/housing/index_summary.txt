As a student at the university, you'll find yourself living in one of the most beautiful places in the world: the residence hall. The term "dorm" means that you live in a room where you can sleep after you return from class, but it doesn't mean that you have to stay there all the time. That's why we call our buildings "residence halls." It's because our staff make sure that every student has a place to live in their residence halls--and that's how we make them feel like they've got a home. Our staff lives on the floor of each residence hall, making sure that students get a safe and supportive environment for their studies. We also have two assistant directors and two residential life managers who work as part of the university's housing services team. They provide staff with training and development so that they can become more effective professionals.
