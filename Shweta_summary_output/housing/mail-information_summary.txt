In order to get your mail, you'll have to go to the mailroom on the second floor of the campus village building. there's no way for you to get a combination of boxes, so if you're having trouble getting it set up, just come to the office and they'll help you. If you've got a package that needs to be picked up at the post office, but doesn't seem to be ready yet, you can send it to usps by using their complete address. It's important to tell the florist who's supposed to deliver during the mail room open hours.
