The university has suspended the live-on requirements for freshmen in order to make it easier for them to get out of college without having to submit an application. Joe west hall, one of the best options for students looking for a place to live, is now available. It's conveniently located near campus village and offers a variety of on-site services like laundry and air conditioning. There's also a resident activity center with a pool and a plethora of other fun things to do.
