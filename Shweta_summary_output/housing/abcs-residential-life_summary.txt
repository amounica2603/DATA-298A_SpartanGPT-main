you'll learn everything you need to know about campus life at San Josee State University. It's a big deal because it's so different from what you're used to at the university. Each building is divided into four buildings: Joe West Hall, Washburn Hall, Campus Village complex, and the other two aren't really all that different. The main dining facility on campus is located in the main building, which is called the "all-you care-to-ate dining facility" on campus. Each of the buildings has its own door dec, which serves as a way for people to get to know each other. Friars are students who live in each building and partner with Uhs employees for social and educational activities. Hicks are current student students who help organize the buildings and plan events for the community. each building has its hall government, or association group, which works like a college student government or an associated student group. These groups are funded by a semester's rent from your housing fee. They also have representatives on the executive board who serve as mentors to the hall governments. Students work in residence halls, which are places where they can feel included and safe. Residence halls are also places where students want to spend their time growing and succeeding. Rha is the central voice of 4,100 of the residents. Each residential community has three rdcs who manage the operation of their communities while serving to support students through their experience at SJsu. Each rndc has extensive background in academic and personal passion areas.
