The campus village gates have an "anti-pass back" feature which enables cars to go back and forth in sequence. If a resident ever wants to use their card to gain entrance or exit, they must do so. This means that if someone else comes into the garage with their card, they will not be able to get out. If they do, they are subject to additional fees.
