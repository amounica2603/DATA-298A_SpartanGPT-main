In the spring of 2022, students will be required to submit an on-campus housing application and pay a non-refundable $50 application fee. If they do not complete their application by the deadline, they will be held responsible for the full academic year in which they are living. Students who wish to cancel their housing license agreement must meet the requirements set forth in the annual lease agreement.
	If a student petitions to cancel their housing license agreement, they will be asked to pay an additional fee. If the student does not pay the initial payment, it is assumed that the student will not be able to borrow money for the rest of the year. The initial payment is used to pay off the fall and spring housing charges. students who receive financial aid than their semester charges will be entitled to a reduction in their housing payment.
	The Bursar's office is happy to help students with any questions they may have about their financial aid. If you are receiving a large amount of financial aid, it is likely that you already have the housing extension on your account and that you will be able to pay in full for the entire semester without incurring late fees. You can also enroll in the "housing installment payment plan" which is the only option available to students at the university. This plan allows students to pay their housing charges in installments over a set number of months instead of having to pay them all at once.
