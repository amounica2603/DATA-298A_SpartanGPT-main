Uhs hours are extended during final exams to ensure that students have a quiet environment while they are studying. noise from the grounds is not permitted between the apartment and the hallways, nor between the common area and the bedrooms. residents may play music or talk in their hallways but must not interfere with their academic or health considerations.
