In the spring of 2023, students will be required to submit an on-campus housing application in order to be admitted to their desired apartment or building for the following academic year. if they do not submit an application and payment by the deadline, they will be held responsible for paying their rent and will not be allowed to move in until after the end of the term. If they fail to pay their rent due to a last-minute rush, they may be asked to sign a lease agreement that does not allow them to stay in their apartment for the winter break.
	In the spring, students must submit an initial housing payment to cover their fall and spring housing charges. If they are receiving more than their tuition and/or board charges, they will be able to borrow money from the university and pay off their housing charges directly. Students who are not receiving financial aid may request an extended period of time to pay their housing costs.
	In the spring, students must enroll in the "housing installment payment plan" which is a type of payment plan that allows students to pay their housing charges in advance. If they have a balance remaining after financial aid is paid, they may choose to enroll in this plan even if they receive financial aid.
