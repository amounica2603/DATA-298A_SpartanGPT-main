"Cleaning the drains" is a common household chore, but it's important to do it right the first time. If your sink is clogged or there's a hole in the wall where the plunger won't work, you should use a soapy cloth over the sink and plunge several times until the clog clears. If the water supply runs out, contact the Facilities Development and Operation Work control desk to ask for assistance during regular business hours at nine 24-1990 or after hours, submit a request.
