The executive director of the recovery-cafe in San Jose a. CÃ³rdo has been serving as the student body president at San Jose State for 30 years. As a result of her service, she has had many opportunities to help people heal from their own experiences. She was also able to use alcohol as an outlet for her sobriety when she worked for community-centered nonprofits and governments. After graduating from sanjose state, she became a volunteer leader for a number of community-based organizations.
