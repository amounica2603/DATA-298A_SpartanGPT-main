the narrator introduces us to some of the history and culture of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe. It's been a long time since salazar started his paints on the river, but now it's time for a new piece of art. This time, the artist is working on a mural that honors the tribe. The muweka oblone tribe has been living in the region for thousands of years. They were once recognized by the federal government, but they have been extinct since then. Since the government doesn't recognize them anymore, they have to go through a lot of trouble to get their rights back.
	Salazar's latest work of art represents a way the muweka have never been able to leave their ancestral home, and it reminds them that they are still welcome at the university. Papazian, president of the university, agrees with papazian that the university must listen to all kinds of people who have been oppressed or ignored before. She also plans to open an Indian and native American student success center in the university campus. The river parkway, which runs 11 miles from Alviso, is one of the most important places in the region for natural and cultural resources. Su, executive director of the river park Conservancy, works with a group of graduate students to study how people use the river trail to engage in nature and culture. They plan to create a long public art corridor along the river path to encourage health and wellness.
