we get a behind-the-scenes look at how he came to be in the field of meteorology. He's been studying the mars atmosphere and trying to figure out what it's like to be a scientist on a mission to study the red planet. Now that he's learned about meteorology, he wants to try to apply his knowledge to the study of other planets. He gets his master's degree in meteorology from San jose State University in 1974 and ma education from the university in 1975. When he finds out about the science of making predictions about the future, jovita encourages him to do so. But when he hears about the way the earth's atmosphere is different from human beings, something changes: he realizes that other worlds have similar atmospheres. So he decides to study them. His mentor, james Pollack, helps him write his first paper on dust storms off mars. That's where he starts working on his second model. It's now the only model ever used to predict the future on mars.
