Deborah Nells, the school's lecturer and program coordinator, is preparing for covid-19. She has been watching students in the nursing classroom using goggles as they watch a patient interact with a virtual reality goggle. In this way, students can see what's going on around them and learn how to care for the patient. Syminar A, a cloud-based health education platform that was developed by an interdisciplinary team of student engineers, is now being used across the country to improve nursing education. The school of nursing uses it to train students in how to perform patient-retrieval tasks.
	Syminar is a powerful tool for nursing students to use in the classroom because it enables them to observe real-world situations and to make critical decisions about how to react to them.
