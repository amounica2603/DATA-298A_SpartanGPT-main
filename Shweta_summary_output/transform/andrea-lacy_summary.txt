Lacy, a mass communications student at San Jose State University, creates a business to sell her baked goods on the web. Her first customer is a friend of hers who offers to hire her as a baker for a company called Hp. When she gets the job, however, she struggles with her grades because of her learning disability. She goes to the disability center and learns how to adjust her grades so that she can get ahead in her studies. After graduating, she stays at Hp moving into an advertising and communications role. In 2000, she takes off her baking business and starts selling her brownie dough on a foodtruck. She also continues to mentor other students at the university. In 2004, she receives an award from the disabled resource center for her efforts in transforming her life.
