we get a little more about what it's like to be a student in the school of nursing at Sjsu. It's hard to believe that you can actually go to college and become a nurse when you haven't even been accepted into the Valley Foundation School of Nursing. Plus, there's just so many other students who are going to be accepted to the school every year. So now that he's a doctor, he can do whatever he wants with his life. Even though he doesn't know how to manage his time at SJsu or how to balance his work and schoollife, i'm able to accomplish my goals.
