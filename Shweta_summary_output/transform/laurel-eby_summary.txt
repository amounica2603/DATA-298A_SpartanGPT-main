Back in the day, we met a mom named Jessel. Jessel's son was about to be born and she decided that she wanted to return to school to become a librarian so that she could work as an employee for the time they were both in school. There was a program called "mlis" at the SJU library, which was basically a job-and-career program for college students who wanted to get their master's degrees in library or information science. The SJu library had a great program too, but Jessel didn't want to go through with it because he loved the idea of being able to work while he was home. So when he got back to school, he did two jobs at the King library: one at Foothill College and one at the San Jose State library. After graduating, Jessel went to work at the King library, where he fell in love with the whole thing. When he finished his ninth year there, i moved to the King Library and started working there again. This time, though, Jim isn't surprised to find that the commute is shorter than he thought it would be.
