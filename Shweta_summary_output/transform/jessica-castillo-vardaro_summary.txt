Castillo Vardaro, an assistant professor of biological sciences at San jose state university, reminisces about her summer as a fifth-year student. She remembers how excited she was to be outside and how excited he was when he became a biologist. Since she joined the university in 2019, she has tried to make it easier for underrepresented minorities to get into the sciences. She is also trying to make sure that students who have no experience in the field aren't discouraged from taking part in her research. One of her students, Emily Hadjes, had thought she wouldn't get into college because she thought she didn't belong. This is why she works as the faculty adviser for society for advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in science at SJsu.
