During his studies at Sjsu, Gulliver gets to take classes from all kinds of different fields. One of his best friends isn't in the environment studies program, so he doesn't think about how his own actions affect the world as much as anyone else he knows. He now works at the San Francisco Zoo, where he works with people who want to help save some of the animals that are threatened by the wild. He also works with staff who work directly with local and distant conservation groups. His studies at school helped him see the "plight" of animals in more context than he ever knew.
