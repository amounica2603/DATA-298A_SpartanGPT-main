Back at the university, we get a little history lesson: back when he was in high school, he applied to SJsu but got rejected. He saved money for college and applied again hoping to get accepted. A couple months later, i got an acceptance. It was so much better than he thought it would be that he actually got accepted. The city of San Jose State transformed him from a student to a person who is now a social worker. He's glad he didn't give up on himself because he had no idea what was in store for him.
