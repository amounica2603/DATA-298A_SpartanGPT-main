San jose state's college of education has been experimenting with new approaches to teaching and learning. The first step in the process is listening. Students, faculty, and other members of the community come together to brainstorm new ways to disrupt higher education. This year-long planning process involves students, teachers, and faculty as well as scholars and policymakers from all over the country. Each department submits proposals for projects that fit into one of the four "pillars" of the college: community engagement,cultural sustainability, Holistic Approaches, and Interdisciplinary Collaboration. After two years of funding, several projects are funded. One of them is an early childhood connection; another is a healthy development clinic; and another is the queer educator and counselors networks. Burciaga was interested in how to subvert these hierarchies because she saw first- generation college students coming to college and finding their homes. She wanted to help create more opportunities for students who didn't want to become school leaders but wanted to make change in their schools. She created the transformative leader minor, which emphasizes that students don't need to be positional leaders to change society. In addition to this program, burciacaga serves as the head of the Institute for Emancipatory Education. All of these programs commit to equality, social justice, and reforming the future of educational systems.
