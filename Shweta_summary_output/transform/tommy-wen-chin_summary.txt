chin describes his journey to studying physics at San jose State University. He was initially drawn to physics when he first came to the U.S. because his parents expected him to be "the best version of himself". When he was 15, his family's peace and happiness shattered when his dad died from an accidental stroke. After finishing high school, he moved to the United States with his uncle, who was a stroke survivor. The relationship between his uncle's household became abusive and he eventually earned a bachelor's degree in physics from San Jose State. Despite his initial hesitation to study physics, however, lacked confidence in pursuing a major at the university. So he decided to study aeronautics. Liam Stnton, an assistant professor of math and statistics, encouraged chin to apply for the calbridge program, which is a post-doctoral program designed to prepare underserved students for doctoral studies in both physics andastronomy at universities in califorria. This program provides support and mentorship for underrepresented students like chin.
