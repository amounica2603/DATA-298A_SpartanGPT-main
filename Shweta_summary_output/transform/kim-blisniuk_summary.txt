Ten years ago, a pair of female geologists named Kimberly Blisniuk and her associate professor of Geology at San jose state university took a walk in the Coachella valley desert. They weren't sure what to look for; they didn't know exactly where they were looking. The fault that runs through most of California is called the "sanandreas fault," and it's responsible for creating a massive earthquake that's about 80 years old overdue. But now that he's found something, he thinks, the next big earthquake might not be as bad as previously thought: the la times report that there are several smaller faults that each carry a certain amount of strain that can lead to an earthquake. These faults are called "strands" because they move past one another over time. Each strand has a specific amount of stress that causes an earthquake--it's called the slip rate. It's important to note that this study doesn't just relate to the faults themselves, but also to how scientists use them to predict future earthquakes
