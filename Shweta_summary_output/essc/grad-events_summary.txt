Spring 2023 is the annual graduate roundtable. It's a chance for students to find out what's going on in the university, get tips and ask questions, and meet other students from across the country. There's also a virtual career fair where you can meet employers who want to hire you. The college of professional and international education has a bunch of events happening during this week. The writing center is throwing a writing workshop for early-career graduate students. They'll all learn about the application process for a bachelor's degree and how to apply for it. Plus, they'll have a whole lot of other fun things like a hammer theater and a contest to win a short scholarship.
