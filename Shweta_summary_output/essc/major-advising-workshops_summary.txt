On Mondays through Fridays, students can attend advising workshops from 8:00am to 12:00pm and from 12:00pm to 4:30pm. If you have an account with SJU that allows you to attend these workshops, you will not be able to register for classes in advance. Instead, you can go to one of the Major advising workshop dates below and make an appointment.
