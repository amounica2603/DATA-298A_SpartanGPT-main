Sjsu's career center is a place for students and alumni to find out what's going on at the university, get help finding a job, and learn about student organizations. There's also a scholarship for first-generous, low- income, or underrepresented students who want to pursue doctoral studies. Also, there's a new study abroad program for students in the summer of 2023. It's called "geotechnical education abroad" and it's designed to give students an opportunity to experience some of the world's most exciting technology and business opportunities while they're at school. Students can apply now and submit their letters of recommendation until the deadline.
