If you're interested in changing your major into the College of Engineering, it's important that you meet all of the requirements. You must have at least 60 earned units to be accepted into the major; otherwise, you won't be able to graduate. If you have less than 60 earned unit, you can apply for the college's change of major program during the fall or spring term. Otherwise, you'll have to talk to an advisor about what classes to take and how much time to complete them. There are other options: students with more than 60 earn unit can use the student success center's "change of major plan" to get an advisor on their side.
