San Jose State University has published a graduate student guide to help students answer common questions about the university. It's divided into six sections: general, admissions, academic planning/enrollment, advancement to candacy, jobs and internships, and culminating experience. These sections are meant to be helpful to current and new graduates at the university because they cover all of the important aspects of the degree program.
