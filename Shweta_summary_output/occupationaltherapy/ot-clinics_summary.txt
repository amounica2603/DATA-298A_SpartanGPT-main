occupational therapy students have the opportunity to attend several types of on-campus and off-campus medical, physical, and/or child-care services during their studies. These services are offered as a "practicum course" for graduate student occupational therapists. mental health, children's, and paternal care are the most common types of outpatient services offered at SJSU. Each student therapist receives one client in the semester for which he is responsible for evaluation and treatment. group activities are one intervention tool used in the various types of medical, social, and school-based practices.
