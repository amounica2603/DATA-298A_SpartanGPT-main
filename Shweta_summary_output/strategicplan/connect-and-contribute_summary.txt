Sjsu Loves San Jose is an effort to bridge the university and the community by bringing new students, culture, and local businesses back to campus. In addition, the university has invested in new sports fields, including beach volleyball court, tennis complex, softball complex, and golf complex. Beyond football is a program that helps students develop professional skills and relationships outside of the playing field so they can become involved with their community after graduation. The university also hires a new Community and Government Relations team to work with the president and other senior leaders to create and promote connections between the city and the surrounding community. The innovation advisory council advises the vice president on how to advance science and innovation at the university.
