Sjsu is a place where "exceptional people" from all over the university come together to do extraordinary things for their lives as learners, creators, champions. A new honors program will be offered in fall 2021 that will focus on transfer students from lower divisions who are not traditionally seen as options in higher education. The center for Community Learning and Leadership has been recognized by Governor Newsom's office as an example of a proposed Calfornians for All College Service program. As part of this effort, the university hires an assistant provost to improve student advising and prepares for a new career development initiative.
