Sjsu's research and innovation division is working hard to create an environment where all faculty and staff are "regional, national and international leaders in their field". In order to make this happen, the university has hired several new staff to help promote grants and other forms of funding. The provost's office is also collecting information on how to improve the mentorship and support practices of black, Native American, and Bipocalypse-diverse faculty. These efforts have resulted in a significant increase in grant proposals during the Pandemic Period. As a result of these efforts, the University receives nearly a quarter of a year's growth in grant applications. Additionally, the division of arts and humanities has created a public voice fellows program to recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of graduate student scholars. Through this program, professors will be able to identify and share their scholarship with the community. Undergraduate research opportunity program Urop is being piloted across the university. This program encourages undergraduate students to engage in real-world, problem-solving, and creative activities that will advance their academic careers.
