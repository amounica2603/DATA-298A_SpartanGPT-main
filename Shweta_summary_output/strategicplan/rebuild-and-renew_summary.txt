San Josee State University has become a leading university in the field of green building and energy efficiency. The Office of Sustainability is charged with making all of the university's buildings be net zero by 2025, which means that every building will use less energy than it was built to be. Sjsu has also invested in new technology to make it easier for students, teachers, and other members of the community to work and learn from wherever they are located. In addition, the university has adopted new communication and information technology tools to support its mission of delivering business value.
	Sjsu's new Interdisciplinary Science Building, South Campus Parking Garage, and the Spontan Recreation and Athletic center are being built. These new buildings will help to create a more interdisciplinary environment on campus.
