In the spring of next year, the Spartan East Side Promise will be a part of student outreach and recruiting. It's our goal to help students become "part of larger community" on campus, to support them in their academic pursuits, and to decrease the percent of academic probation that isn't due out of college. We'll also have a reception for newly admitted students from the eastside union High School District. This event is free, but there's plenty of food and swag to make it look like you're getting ready to go to school.
