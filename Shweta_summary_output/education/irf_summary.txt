The Institute for Regenerative Futures is a community-based, intergenerational collective of black people, elders and healing practitioners who are committed to reviving the future through memory, practice, and service. This year, the institute plans to listen to residents of the East San jose community and develop a new health-based education program that will improve maternal health and childbirth outcomes. Dr. Emerald Templeton works with teachers in the San Francisco Bay area to track changes in their students' health over one year. She is an experienced scholar-practor who has worked at a local community college as well as a school district in oakland. She hopes to become a mentor to other young people who are interested in youth development.
	The gap between youth health and today's school system has deepened by combined conversations with education leadership that are pushing us to course correct, and innovation how we love our students. at the end of the evening, we invite you to join us for a discussion on how we can improve our student experience.
