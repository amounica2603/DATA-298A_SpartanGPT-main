In the fall and spring of next year, undergraduate student scholars gather at SJU to learn more about their own learning experiences. They then use photographs and narrative to share those stories with other students across campus. The project's coordinator, Brietty Curtner, tells us that she hopes this project will change the narrative on campus by bringing in more student voices. In episode 2, we meet several of the student researchers who have been involved in curating an exhibition of student stories.
