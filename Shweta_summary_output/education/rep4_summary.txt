The Rapid Education Prototyping alliance is an alliance of six leading higher education partners including the Sjsu Lurie College of Education. This alliance brings together students, teachers, and industry leaders to develop new ideas for teaching and learning. At the end of the day, they present their proposals to the president and senior leadership. They all agree on what they want to do. One of the goals of the alliance is to create a skill building course that will give students hands-on experience of college life. Through this course, students will gain access to free resources and organizations that will benefit from student internships. Students will be paired with experienced college mentors so that they can learn how to apply to colleges and become successful. In addition, they will have a mentor who will help them find a job.
