Liurie College of Education is proud to offer three student research awards for the upcoming academic year. These awards will provide students with financial support to conduct their own research and present it at a conference. Undergraduate, graduate credential, doctoral students can also apply for one $500 grant towards expenses for travel, lodgings, and meals during the conference. In addition, the university's new student scholarship, creative activity, and research project program replaces the old undergraduate research grant program. This new initiative will provide financial support for students who are involved in rca with an experienced faculty mentor.
