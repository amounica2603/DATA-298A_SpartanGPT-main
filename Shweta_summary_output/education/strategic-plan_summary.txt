After months of dialogue and deliberation, the college unanimously adopts a new strategy in Januaryuary2020. In addition, it is committed to take action to advance "Racial justice" in our community, our faculty, and our staff. These actions will help us realize that we are not only building a strong institution but also a system that has prevented full equality and shared power for bipoc scholars, teachers, and students. The next year, they will report on how well they're doing. Next, they'll launch the institute for Emancipatory Education, an organization dedicated to creating more equal and inclusive education systems so that all learners can thrive. They'll also launch a healthy development center in east side San Jose to strengthen community engagement with Latino children and families.
	This chapter introduces a new program at the university called "ecc" or "community-engaged," which will bring together faculty and students from across the college who are interested in learning about early childhood development. The goal of the project is to develop an "intersectional disability studiesstrand" that will serve as one of the centers of the institution's "ids." It will also provide support for several other projects, including the ethnic studies residenship program, teacher preparation pathways for African American, Chicana, O/X, and Native American studies teachers, and professional education for science teachers.
	This minor prepares students for a variety of leadership roles in their communities. It is located in the Sjsu Lurie College of Education's Department of Educational Leadership and is housed in the student union.
