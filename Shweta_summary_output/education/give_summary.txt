The Sjsu Lurie College of Education prepares brightest and most committed teachers in the bay region and beyond. Our mission is to prepare transformative, educated leaders for the community through teaching, scholarship, and service. We have a new health development center that will be open in 2022. In addition, our school has a kaccd or child development laboratory that will serve as a place for young children to develop their minds and bodies.
