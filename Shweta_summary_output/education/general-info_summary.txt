if you're looking for an education specialist credential, you must meet the subject matter competency requirements of one of these options. If you've got a bachelor's or master's degree from another institution, you can use this option to get your teacher credential validated. candidates who have taken multiple subjects or single subject courses at another institution will not be required to pass the exam. However, if they're trying to get a job as a teacher, they must fulfill the state's "basic skills" requirement. This means that anyone who has taken college or university courses outside of the united states must get an evaluation of their foreign transcripts before being granted a teaching credential. The commission also requires teachers to complete a course covering the "u.S. constitution" before getting a student's teacher certificate.
