The Queer Educators and Counselors Network at the Sjsu Lurie College of Education is a place where students, teachers, and counselors can come together and learn about their own experiences as international students. Robert Marx, an assistant professor with the department of Child and Adolescent Development, works as a community engaged scholar in reframing "domestic visions" of queer people so that they do not become deviant or damaged but rather as complex people who are capable of changing them. He also serves as the co- founder of the International Safe Zone, a program to help international students adjust to life on the U.S. campus.
