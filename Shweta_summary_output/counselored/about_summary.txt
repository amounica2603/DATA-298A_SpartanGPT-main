San Jose State University's Department of counselor education conducts an annual evaluation of its academic program to ensure that it is meeting its goals. Each year, the department receives a wide range of student and community-based engagement in the planning and execution of the program. In particular, the university's "gear up" community achievement project has resulted in a significant increase in graduation rates for low- income students across eight schools.
