The next few years are going well for counselor education students at the university, and they're getting ready to help other students make the transition to college. They've got a lot of new students in the process, too, like janet canseco, who was one of the speakers at the school's graduation celebration. She's excited about working as a counselor because she wants to close the achievement gap between first- generation, low- income college students from different backgrounds so they can achieve their educational goals. Huy le has been selected by the university to be a student mentor for the upcoming academic year. He's also an extraordinary graduate, which makes him even more popular among the professors. victor cavillo co-hosts the "study-leddialgoue" web series with the jsu laure college of education during the fall 2021 semester.
