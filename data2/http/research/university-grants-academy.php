the university grants academy (uga) supports faculty members from across the campus through the process of writing a significant external grant proposal to fund their research, scholarship, and creative activity (rsca). historically, the uga has been a semester-long developmental experience designed for faculty members to increase their capacity to obtain extramurally funded grants. since 2022, we have offered the spring semester uga and a 10-week accelerated summer uga program. the spring and summer uga program involves the following: a final large-group celebration of the uga program which includes an updated rendition of “research in a minute” presentations to facilitate networking and future research collaborations. the full uga request for proposals, applications, deadlines, and frequently asked questions (faqs) are all available here via the infoready platform . those applying for summer semester sessions will receive a $4,000 fellowship. spring applicants must consult with their department chair prior to submitting any documentation, as this session provides a 0.2 at buyout. all uga participants will receive an additional $500 in professional development funds, paid into their sjsurf rsca accounts, provided a proposal is submitted through the research foundation or tower foundation by the first open submission window after summer session uga completion. note: the kinds of projects considered “rsca” vary by discipline, department and college; in general, rsca work results in accomplishments that would be listed in the scholarly/artistic/professional achievements category of your faculty dossier. “creative activity” refers to those activities aligned with the scholarly/artistic/professional achievements category of the dossier for faculty in creative tracks of their disciplines. if you have questions about whether your project would be categorized as rsca, consult with your chair, your college associate dean of research (or relevant contact), or review your college rsca metrics. you may also email the director of research development (position vacant as of 10/15/2022) or email the office of research . any additional questions concerning the uga should be directed to the office of research .
