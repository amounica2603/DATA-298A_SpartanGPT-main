many funders require researchers to submit a plan outlining how scientific data from their research will be managed and shared. a data management plan (dmp) is a formal document that describes how data will be controlled during the course of research and at the conclusion of a study or project. a data sharing plan (dsp) is a document that describes how data will be disseminated at the conclusion of a research project. these two documents may be separate or combined, and dmp and dsp are often used interchangeably. funders who require these plans want a detailed description of how you will manage, secure and share data. in many cases, reviewers are asked to evaluate the plan, and it may or may not be included in the scoring of your proposal. be sure to review the funding opportunity announcement for this information. some funders will review this document prior to finalizing an award. national science foundation generic data management plan template [docx] national institutes of health data management and sharing plan guidance [docx]  national institutes of health data management and sharing plan guidance [docx] - department of defense data management plan template [docx] department of energy data management plan template [docx] department of energy (doe): office of energy efficiency and renewable energy (eere) data management plan template [docx] institute of museum and library services (imls) data management plan template [docx] - a data management plan and/or a digital products plan [docx] may be required for certain grants. review nofo for requirements. the dmptool is a free, open-source, online application that helps researchers create data management plans. it is a click-through wizard for creating a dmp that complies with funder requirements. help with registering for this free tool . sjsu library data management resources dmps samples for several nsf directorates and divisions from uc san diego
