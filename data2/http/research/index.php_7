we’re in the midst of a unique and challenging period here at sjsu—indeed, with our entire nation and global community. but although we’ve had to cancel or postpone many in-person events—including our annual celebration of research—we were determined to carry on and develop an alternative method for recognizing and honoring our student and faculty researchers. voilà—the virtual event web page you are now visiting. sjsu’s celebration of research salutes the great research work of both our faculty members our students; in particular, we see how our faculty efforts in research, scholarship and creative activities (rsca) directly support the success of our students. through those rsca endeavors, our students stay engaged in their classes, gain important hands-on experiences for their careers and are better prepared to pursue a degree of higher education. through this virtual event website, we can all take great pride in our faculty research successes and honorthe achievements of this year’s two early career investigator award winners , kim blisniuk and yue “wilson” yuan, and the 12 csu statewide student research competition entrants. these, as well as the 90+ undergraduate research grant participating students, can all be celebrated while you learn about their fascinating work and projects. finally, three creative activities are also showcased, and i would invite you to learn more about them: spatial arts lecturer yvonne escalante’s exceptional work in developing an electroforming workspace on campus; assistant professor of graphic design yoon chung han’s human iris project ; and the threepenny opera performances. all of these projects are just amazing! we have a world-class faculty and student body eager to innovate and place their stamp on the world and do great things. so while we’re all sheltering-in-place, let’s take some time to celebrate some of the fantastic research, scholarship and creative activity our faculty and students are involved in year round. enjoy, and congratulations to all of our honorees! mohamed abousalem vice president for research and innovation
