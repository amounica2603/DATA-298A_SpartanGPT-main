the irb office receives hundreds of applications every year and is run by a single staff member. if you wish to ensure a smooth and efficient process, you are responsible for making the effort to address the following common application problems. overall, the more time you invest in checking and proofreading your submission, the faster the review and approval process. please do not expect irb staff and irb members to assume this responsibility for you. emails sent to the irb analyst asking for a check of the materials prior to submission to the irb mentor system will not receive a response.
