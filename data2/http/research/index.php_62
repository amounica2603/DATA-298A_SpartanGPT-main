most proposals to external funders are not funded on the first round. in fact principal investigators usually submit 2-3 proposals for every one funded ( for nsf it is 2.3 ). the office of research wants to help faculty leverage the work already invested in a proposal that was not accepted for funding. thus research development (rd) has resubmissions support that takes several forms. attend our grant getting workshop on proposal resubmissions. it covers all the needed steps for turning a failed submission into a competitive and hopefully successful submission. see our workshop webpage for the next live offering (recommended) or watch the recorded video of our pick of the best version of this workshop. a research development specialist (rds) is always available to meet with you, go over your reviews (if available) and make a plan for resubmission to the same, or a different funder, as appropriate. we can create a timeline that includes all the needed steps and provide support all along the way. this program follows a timeline structure to support faculty in getting ready for a resubmission. the steps can be followed by an individual working with an rds, or a group of faculty working on a similar area (e.g. proposals all from a specific college) or on the same proposal (e.g. the nsf career). in this program, if all the milestones are met via a pre-negotiated timeline, the office of research will pay for an external review by an expert in the proposal subject area. these reviews greatly increase the quality and competitiveness of the proposal, and often lead to ongoing mentoring relationships with the reviewer. an example of a 10-week timeline is shown in table 1. an example of an individual program, is shown in table 2. if you are interested in either program please contact your rds or the director of rd . 2 - 5 6 7 7 - 10 follow-up 2 - 5 6 7 - 10 follow-up
