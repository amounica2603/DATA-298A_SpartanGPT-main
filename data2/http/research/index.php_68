private foundations are a great way to fund your research, scholarship, and creative activity (rsca)! gifts and philanthropic grants from private foundations are handled through the sjsu tower foundation. non-philanthropic grants and competitive faculty fellowships, on the other hand, are handled through the sjsu research foundation. non-philanthropic grants come with specific compliance requirements (e.g. publishing in specific journal types, or intellectual property management). for further details, please refer to this memo [pdf] . in general, do not worry about which sjsu foundation to turn to, simply reach out with your questions by email to towerandresearch@sjsu.edu or to deborah maloney, director, office of sponsored programs, at deborah.maloney@sjsu.edu (408) 924-1421, or sela gaglia, executive director of corporate and foundation relations at sela.gaglia@sjsu.edu (408) 924-7033.
