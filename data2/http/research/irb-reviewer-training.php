the sjsu irb has an expedited review process for minimal risk research in which a single irb reviewer evaluates a research protocol to determine whether the protection of human subjects in research has been ensured. full review by all committee members can be selected when needed by the individual reviewer when the research is greater than minimal risk. to begin reviewing irb protocols: notify the human protections analyst and the current irb chair (see contact info below) that you have been appointed to serve on the irb. the human protections analyst will provide you with a training packet that outlines the responsibilities of irb members and instructions for protocol review. complete the mandatory online training course for irb reviewers through the collaborative institutional training initiative (citi) . after creating and account with citi using your sjsu email address, select san jose state university courses. click on "add a course or update learner groups." go to question #2 and select "irb members." once you have completed the training, email a pdf copy of your transcript report to the human protections analyst. communicate your availability to the human protections analyst; if you will be unavailable by email, please notify the analyst, so that protocols are not sent to you. keep in mind that extended periods of unavailability result in other reviewers having to take more protocols. reviewers are expected to complete their review within 10 business days or sooner. irb meetings are usually held once a month. the meeting schedule and location will be determined by the irb chair at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters. a reminder email will be sent out prior to the meeting. please be sure to check your email in case a meeting is canceled. the irb will meet from 9am - 10am via zoom on the following dates: august 19, 2022 september 16, 2022 october 21, 2022 november 18, 2022 december 16, 2022 the irb will meet from 9am - 10am via zoom on the following dates: february 17, 2023 march 17, 2023 april 21, 2023 may 19, 2023 alena filip human protections analyst office of research 408-924-2479 alena.filip@sjsu.edu dr. areum k. jensen irb chair (408) 924-8153 areum.jensen@sjsu.edu dr. richard mocarski institutional official and associate vice president of research 408-924-2488 richard.mocarski@sjsu.edu dr. jessica trask senior director of research services 408-924-2460 jessica.trask@sjsu.edu current irb members: committee membership information is posted and updated on the academic senate website . in addition to having thorough knowledge of sjsu policy for protection of human research subjects, irb reviewers are expected to be familiar with the corresponding federal regulations posted on the office of human research protections (ohrp) website. code of federal regulations 45cfr46 policy for protection of human research subjects irb review criteria worksheet [pdf]
