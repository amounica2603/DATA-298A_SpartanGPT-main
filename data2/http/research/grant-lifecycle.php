obtaining extramural support for your research, scholarship, and creative activity (rsca) is critical to creating a vibrant rsca trajectory that benefits you, your students, sjsu, and the wider community. below we walk you through all the components of funding a single rsca project and the support available to you at sjsu. submitting a fundable proposal to an external granting agency requires that you present a well-thought-out idea. most proposals need several months to adequately flesh out the project ideas. allow yourself and others involved in your research process adequate time to assist you in developing the project scope and submitting a quality proposal. the office of research development is here to support your rsca starting with idea generation through offering formal brainstorming sessions, individual consultations, helping establish collaborative connections, etc. 1. talk to colleagues, your associate dean of research (adr), dean, and/or chair about your rsca idea and how it can translate into a fully-fledged rsca project. 2. familiarize yourself with the current literature in your field and projects funded by agencies in your area of research. 3. think strategically. how does this project fit into your long-term strategic rsca planning? does it set you up for additional future funding opportunities? does it primarily benefit your rsca or teaching goals, or is it integrative of both? do you need to plan to get preliminary data through internal sjsu funding before you can be competitive for external sources of funding? successfully funding a rsca project involves finding an appropriate funding mechanism. funding agencies have their own agendas and philosophies, therefore it is vital to make sure your work matches the funding agency’s priorities before investing time in writing a proposal. with a broad set of agencies from federal to private, your rsca should have a funder whose priorities match your goals. sjsu offers several resources to locate funding suited to your rsca proposal. 1. stay on top of funding relevant to your field! pivot is a new tool you can use to set up tailored searches and monitor funding from federal, state, and local agencies as well as foundations and international funding sources. create your account today to constantly monitor for funding that fits your rsca needs. 2. read the mid-monthly avpr electronic research newsletter and the top-of-the-month newsletter ( archives here ) which have information on the new limited submissions and strategic grants list from research development. these lists can also be accessed anytime on our general funding web page . 3. contact your research development specialist (rds) to discuss funding strategies for research projects at any

with the office of sponsored programs on submission. rd can assist in finding collaborators or forming teams, coordinating and managing large proposals, concept development, and strategic editing, including enhancing the structure and presentation of all proposal components. these services are optional. however, research shows they increase the likelihood of funding by a factor of two . please

objectives, scope projects, and develop sponsored research agreements, which meet the needs of both parties. they act as the liaison between sjsu and the company while also helping to coordinate the submission and award management activities required by the office of sponsored programs (osp). if you have an industry-related research opportunity, or if you anticipate the research will have practical or commercial applications and need a strategy for protecting background or future intellectual property (ip), please consult the office of innovation . all sponsored project proposals, including competitive faculty fellowships, sub-contracts, contractual agreements linked to sponsored projects, as well as all philanthropic-corporate and foundations grants, must be reviewed by sjsu’s

international shipments, or sending data to collaborators at non-us universities all have additional compliance requirements. sjsu supports publication in high-quality journals, conferences, and other venues appropriate to your field. most funders allow publication and dissemination costs as part of the budget, so please include them in your proposal whenever possible and ask rd/osp/cfr for help in planning for and incorporating these fees into your initial proposal. if at the end of a rsca project you find you are in need of funds to disseminate your work and maximize its impact, consider a rsca seed grant , or check with research development or your associate dean of research for funding options. if you plan to publish a book, contact the office of innovation to discuss book-related ip
