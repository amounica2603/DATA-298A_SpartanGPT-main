sjsu has transitioned from an email submission system for studies involving human subjects to a cloud-based submission and review system called irb mentor. we are now accepting submissions via irb mentor.  for irb mentor submission information, including how to manage pre-irb mentor approved studies, please visit our submission page . you may not begin any recruitment, enrollment, or data collection until you have received a formal approval letter from the sjsu irb, regardless of the review type associated with the submission. this includes submitting any formal requests for the use of secondary data. if data are collected prior to receiving irb approval, you may not use that data in your research. sjsu investigators with an external irb approval should visit our collaborative and external studies page for details on what will be needed to register their external irb approval within the irb mentor system in order to allow the irb office to initiate a reliance agreement with the reviewing irb. all post approval reporting is handled via the irb mentor system. this includes: requesting modifications to an approved protocol, reporting incidents and study deviations, continuing review renewals or study status check-ins, and study closures. for information on how to file these post approval reports please visit our submission page and review our irb mentor user guide for post-approval reporting [pdf] .
