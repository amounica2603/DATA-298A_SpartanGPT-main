the major goal of the sjsu caps’ training program is to provide high quality, multicultural-focused learning experiences to postdoctoral residents and psychology interns (hereafter referred to as “trainees”) in counseling/clinical psychology in preparation for a career in mental health. to help attain this goal, the counseling faculty has a strong commitment to supervise, teach, and mentor our trainees. our training is guided by a practitioner-scholar model in which we train clinicians to be informed of theory and research in the science of psychology. our supervisors represent a broad base of theoretical backgrounds, thus trainees are exposed to various models. we emphasize short-term treatment approaches that meet the needs of a diverse college and graduate student body. we also strongly acknowledge that we live in a diverse world with continued ongoing diversity-related issues and injustices. we thus believe in the utmost importance of being dedicated to multicultural awareness and humility. we believe in the need to engage in this process on a daily basis by being aware of our multiple social identities and interactions of those with others, acknowledging our biases, being aware of societal contexts that impact us on a constant basis, and advocating for various marginalized populations. thus these beliefs and values are embedded into our training program and multiple elements described below. we also strive to provide trainees with challenging and developmentally appropriate training experiences. we accomplish this by emphasizing training that is sequential, cumulative, and graded in complexity. we provide didactic trainings, experiential learning (direct service), mentorship, and role modeling from various staff members. we encourage self-examination and awareness of the impact of self on others. at caps we also believe that different levels of trainees have different developmental needs. we work with postdoctoral residents and health service psychology interns. thus, some trainees will be separated for various training activities, while for other components of training all trainees will meet together in order to optimize the diverse perspectives that arise when combining various training levels. we are proud members of the association of counseling center training agencies (accta) – a national organization for training programs within university counseling centers. our internship training is a member of the association of psychology postdoctoral and internship centers (appic). our internship has been accredited by the american psychological association (apa) since 2012 and was re-accredited for 10 years in 2019. caps abides by the ethical principles of psychologists and conduct of conduct. our internship and postdoctoral programs meet state licensure requirements and provides broad training covering all the major areas of knowledge and skills expected of a psychologist in a university counseling center setting (standard 7.01), provides an accurate description of the training program, goals and objectives, stipends, benefits and exit criteria (standard 7.02), provides training as described in the program materials (standard 7.03), does not require interns to disclose or discuss personal information except as it is related to their developing skills and professional effectiveness (standard 7.04), does not mandate outside therapy experiences (standard 7.05), provides evaluations of interns in a timely manner (standard 7.06), and prohibits sexual relationships between interns and supervisory staff (standard 7.07). to train entry-level psychologists whose professionalism includes self-awareness, culturally-responsive practice, and communication/interpersonal skills, for ethical and effective practice in the field of health service psychology. we have outlined the following training competencies and elements: these competencies will be addressed and facilitated through modeling by professionals, supervision, didactic training, experiential learning, and mentoring. these goals will be assessed by providing written and verbal feedback to each intern. this video contains information about the sjsu caps psychology internship program shared by our clinical supervisors. hosted by the intern training coordinator, our caps supervisors address common questions asked by applicants over the years in a panel format. this video was created to help those interested in our program to learn more about our caps atmosphere and the internship year. agency description san josé state university caps is a department within the division of student affairs at san josé state university. caps offers services designed to help san josé state's diverse student body of 30,000 identify and accomplish their academic and career goals, enhance personal development, meet life's challenges, and improve interpersonal relationships. caps is established as a comprehensive counseling center offering core clinical services, developmental and life skills interventions, consultations, and outreach to our diverse student population. short-term counseling and psychotherapy are the primary means of direct service delivery. agency objective caps provides quality culturally-responsive services to students so they can achieve their goals of becoming successful graduates of san josé state university, both academically and socially. to fulfill this objective, we look at the whole student based on their sociocultural background and provide guidance and tools to become productive and well-rounded. to do that, professionally trained psychologists, social workers, and counselors are available for students on an individual or group basis for counseling on a myriad of psychological and academic issues. in addition, we provide services such as outreach presentations for students, student groups, staff/faculty, and staff consultations on issues of student mental health and campus climate; and professional training, teaching, and supervision for future mental health personnel, consistent with the educational mission of the university. population served caps provides services for all enrolled students of san josé state university. the student population of sjsu is a highly diverse group. for example, there is no one clear majority group (more than 50%) in terms of ethnicity on the campus and ages range from late teens to many students in their fifties. in addition, there is diversity around ability/disability, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, social class, nationality, and more. please see here for more information on sjsu's population: https://www.sjsu.edu/diversity/diversity-equity-inclusion/demographics/index.html theoretical orientation caps' staff utilize a variety of theoretical positions including integrative, psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, feminist, multicultural, gestalt, humanistic, and systems perspectives. generally, an integrated approach to counseling and psychotherapy is shared by the staff. diversity and social justice training training in multiculturally oriented therapy and counseling is integrated into all training activities. as noted, sjsu caps serves a highly diverse population. psychology interns participate in a weekly diversity discussion group/seminar (fall/spring) and social justice and outreach training seminars (in fall) where social justice and outreach issues are integrated and discussed in depth. psychology interns also provide various outreach and workshops and are guided to provide these in a culturally sensitive manner to diverse populations. lastly, caps hosts an annual conference: multicultural training day. trainees and training directors from university counseling centers in the bay area are invited to attend and share in a day of multicultural learning and dialogue (e.g., topics include addressing racial trauma, working with lgbtq populations, working with undocumented students etc). see changes in this conference in the pandemic below. components of the clinical psychology internship training program there are four major component areas of the training program. these areas are multiculturalism/cultural humility, training, direct service, and indirect service. in addition, there may be other training opportunities available throughout the training year. multiculturalism/ cultural humility: at caps we value multiculturalism, cultural humility, and social justice and work to actively engage in our own self-reflection processes, acquire culture-specific knowledge, and provide culturally sensitive services to our campus population. thus, when providing individual, couples, crisis and group counseling, attending supervision, and providing consultation and outreach programming to attending training seminar presentations, psychology interns and post doctoral residents will be guided to think of the recipient of services as a whole embedded in layers of systems and cultural contexts, learn how to conceptualize and explore these layers and various social identities with clients, and reflect on their own cultural backgrounds and identities as counselors, psychologists-in-training, and professionals-to-be. for instance, psychology interns and postdoctoral residents also partake in a social justice and outreach seminar to further discuss how to be social justice advocates. caps also hosts an annual one-day multicultural training day conference, that all interns and postdoctoral residents attend. this has been combined with the northern california training day conference (nctd) during the pandemic and will continue to do so for this year. training: seminars supervision/case consultation *individual supervision will be conducted in a hybrid model (in-person and/or online) and is up to the comfort of the trainee and supervisor. this is in accordance with apa and the ca board of psychology guidelines. this is subject to change in accordance with apa and the ca board of psychology, and interns and postdoctoral residents will continue to be updated about this during the year. direct service: direct service hours are provided through individual, couple, and group counseling sessions; outreach presentations; and assessment/crises coverage. the provision of direct service hours are done through consultation with your primary supervisor. psychology interns are expected to accrue approximately 20.5 hours of direct service per week in fall, 22.5 hours in spring and summer. a primary supervisor, in consultation with the training coordinator and associate director, may help adjust the amount of direct service hours provided by an intern depending on the intern’s individual needs and situation (e.g., accommodations for disability). indirect service: other training opportunities: our training program for psychology interns is for 2000 hours of supervised professional experience (spe), accrued over 12 months and . training generally begins around early or mid-august. we will solicit 4 psychology interns. psychology interns are expected to be
