it is critical that counselors are well-prepared to advance learning and development, informed by a strong commitment and paradigmatic orientation to social justice. through our faculty-led study abroad programs, students learn about and reflect on issues of community and cultural development, international and cross-cultural issues, sustainability (environmental, social, political, and economic), community development and human service, and human rights and citizenship education. learn more about our recent study abroad course below. this program featured a partnership with the u.n-mandated university for peace (upeace), located in san jose, costa rica. upeace was established in december 1980 as a treaty organization by the un general assembly. upeace's mission is: “to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the charter of the united nations.” this course utilized inquiry-based and seminar-style learning experiences. in addition to the program leaders, students had opportunities to learn from distinguished international and local guest speakers and facilitators in classroom settings at the upeace campus and on guided tours and site visits. other program years in costa rica included: 2012, 2013, 2014, 2105, and 2018. check out some of the pictures below. class at the university for peace school in la carpio monteverde cloud forrest reserve upeace outdoor group activity tarcoles sustainable fishing village la carpio spice farm downtown san jose, costa rica  university for peace (upeace) monument nacientes palmichal university for peace (upeace) monument nacientes palmichal butterfly farm painting homes with the kids in la carpio  la carpio - picture with kids and painted trash dispensary university for peace (upeace) monument university of costa rica nacientes palmichal cloud forest school coffee farm university for peace (upeace) classroom nacientes palmichal poas volcano sjsu department of counselor education sweeney hall 404 one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0073 mondays: 8am-12pm, 1-5pm tuesdays: 8am-12pm, 1-5pm wednesdays: 8am-12pm, 1-5pm thursdays: 8am-12pm, 1-5pm fridays: available by phone or email
