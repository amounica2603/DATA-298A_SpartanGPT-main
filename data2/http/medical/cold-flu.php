the cdc recommends that universities do not require a doctor’s note to confirm illness or recovery. in accordance with this recommendation, the sjsu student health center does not issue doctor’s notes, sick notes or “excuses” for influenza like illnesses (ili). not having students come in for sick notes also helps to limit the spread of influenza like illnesses (ili) to students seeking treatment for other injuries or illnesses. it also helps to maintain student/professor communication as the context for determining whether course requirements are being met or not.  phone: 408-924-6122 appointments/general info 408-924-6150 patient billing the student wellness center building (swc) is located across from the event center. parking is available in the seventh street garage. student wellness center san josé state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0037 monday - thursday: 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. friday (march 31): closed monday - thursday: 8:30am – 5:00pm friday: 8:30am – 4:30pm call to schedule an appointment
