under the "complete aid process" tab, click on "parent plus mpn." plus credit counseling is a requirement since your credit was denied. go to to the federal student aid website. under "apply for aid" tab, click on "complete plus credit counseling." steps for endorser to complete: the endorser must go to to the federal student aid website and create his or her own personal fsa user id & password, if they don't already have one. go to to the federal student aid website. under the "apply for aid" tab, click on "endorse a plus loan." the u.s. department of education will have provided an endorser code to the parent borrower after credit was initially denied. the parent may find this code in their email. interest accrues on the unpaid balance of the loan from the date of disbursement by the school until the entire principal balance is paid in full. failure to make monthly or quarterly interest payments results in the interest being capitalized (added to the principal of the loan). unlike other types of financial aid, the plus loan is not need based. the maximum eligibility amount is determined by the student's cost of attendance minus any financial aid that the student has been awarded. the plus loan can replace all or a portion of a student's financial aid award. plus applicants can borrow up to the full cost of attendance if the student declines all offered student loans (subsidized/unsubsidized). parents/graduate students do not need to to apply for the entire loan amount being offered to the student (refer to mysjsu portal for the amount of the plus loan eligible to borrow). parents/students should calculate the amount they need. parents: if your student does not intend on using federal work study, you can add that amount to the plus loan request.  if the loan is for one semester, the loan will be disbursed in one disbursement. if the loan is a full-year loan, the loan will be disbursed in two increments: first half in the fall and the second half in the spring. if the student owes money to san jose state university, the university deducts all financial obligations first, and forwards the balance to the borrower. for a parent plus loan, a check is sent to the parent if the borrower is the refund preference. otherwise, if the student is the refund preference, a check is sent to the student or direct deposit is initiated. we encourage students to sign up for direct deposit. repayment and interest will apply to funds after the loan has been disbursed. the first payment of interest and principal are due within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed. an in-school deferment may be requested while the student is enrolled at least half time (6 undergraduate units; 4 graduate/professional units). parents: if the student drops to less than half time or withdraws during the period for which the loan was intended, the entire amount of the plus loan is immediately due. graduate/professional students: interest that accrues will be capitalized if not paid by the student contact financial aid counselor amber kizniene by emailing amber.kizniene@sjsu.edu . email: fao@sjsu.edu _________________________ phone: 408-283-7500 ext 4 monday to friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. _________________________ live chat tuesday to friday 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. __________________________ virtual appointments friday from 10:00 a.m - 3:00 p.m. _________________________ in-person appointments monday to thursday 8:15 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. __________________________ student services center (ssc) 9 street & san fernando (on 1 floor of north parking garage) financial aid and scholarship office san josé state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0036
