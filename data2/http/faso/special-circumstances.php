financial aid awards are based on the results of the application which has information from tax year 2020 (for fall 2022-spring 2023). however, your 2020 tax year information may not accurately represent your current financial situation. if you experience a special circumstance, you have an opportunity to file for a review of special circumstances where you request the financial aid office to look at either your 2021 or 2022 taxes for aid during fall 2022-spring 2023. some examples of special circumstances include: contact the financial aid & scholarship office to discuss the changes in your financial situation and to request a review of special circumstances. we know that there are many circumstances that may impact a family's ability to contribute to a student's education, and we will work with you to understand your options and determine if any additional aid may be available based on your individual circumstances. unfortunately, not all circumstances will be eligible for consideration, and not all appeals will result in additional financial assistance. the cost of attendance includes average amounts for standard educational expenses incurred by students who attend sjsu during the academic year. these averages are provided to us by the california student aid commission. families do have an opportunity to request an increase in their cost of attendance for one of the following reasons: if a budget increase is approved, it is unlikely that it will be covered by any additional grant funding. you would need to apply for the additional loan program, typically: direct parent plus loans, direct grad plus loans, or alternative student loan funding. there is a maximum increase of $10,000 per academic year that can be considered. contact the financial aid & scholarship office to discuss any additional expenses you may have incurred to see if they justify a review of extraordinary expenses. receipts will need to be provided. email: fao@sjsu.edu _________________________ phone: 408-283-7500 ext 4 monday to friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. _________________________ live chat tuesday to friday 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. __________________________ virtual appointments friday from 10:00 a.m - 3:00 p.m. _________________________ in-person appointments monday to thursday 8:15 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. __________________________ student services center (ssc) 9 street & san fernando (on 1 floor of north parking garage) financial aid and scholarship office san jos√© state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0036
