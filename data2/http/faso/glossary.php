here are definitions for common terms used in financial aid: this means that parental information is considered in determining a student's eligibility for financial aid. note that a student may be living away from home and not receiving any money from parents and still be dependent for financial aid purposes. also, students are not considered independent just because their parents are not claiming them on their tax return. generally, any student under age 24 is considered dependent. forbearance is a way to postpone or reduce the payments on a student loan. forbearance differs from a deferment in three ways: 1: it is not a legal requirement; 2: it is given at the lender's (or holder of the loan) discretion; and 3: interest continues to acrrue even if forebearance is granted (see also deferment).  email: fao@sjsu.edu _________________________ phone: 408-283-7500 ext 4 monday to friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. _________________________ live chat tuesday to friday 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. __________________________ virtual appointments friday from 10:00 a.m - 3:00 p.m. _________________________ in-person appointments monday to thursday 8:15 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. __________________________ student services center (ssc) 9 street & san fernando (on 1 floor of north parking garage) financial aid and scholarship office san jos√© state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0036
