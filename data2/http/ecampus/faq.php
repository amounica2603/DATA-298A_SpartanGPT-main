processing: 1. your quicktime file has external references. quicktime allows you to edit videos, including adding pieces of separate video files. unfortunately, saving from quicktime merely references pieces of separate videos, which means that they’re not included in the file that’s uploaded. 2. your video file contains a portion of either audio or video that is not supported. 3. your video file is corrupt or its format is unidentifiable and doesn’t match the file extension. this is related to your browser and computer screen size. one tip: if you are zoomed into 100%, try adjusting it to 90%.  at this time while students can download videos they submitted, they cannot download the comments they received on their video submission. if you did not find an answer to your question, email
