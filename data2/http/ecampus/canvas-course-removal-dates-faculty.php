the senate-approved canvas course retention guidelines specify that faculty members will retain full access to their courses on canvas for two years. this includes full access to course content, student submissions, and grades. faculty members can download a copy of the gradebook and export a copy of the course. after the two years, the courses will get moved into an archive and will no longer appear in the canvas course list. if materials are needed after the two year period, faculty members can contact the canvas administrators with their requests. phone: 408-924-2337 email: ecampus@sjsu.edu location: irc, room 206 ecampus, irc206 instructional resource center san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0026
