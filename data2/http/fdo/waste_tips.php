though this site has concentrated mostly on presenting the recycling opportunities available at san jose state university, we don't want to leave out one of the most important aspects of any effective waste management program, waste reduction. waste reduction (also known as waste prevention) is the practice of minimizing or reducing waste generated from the beginning, in an effort to have less to discard or recycle at the end. whenever you buy disposable items or products with excess packaging, you're essentially buying trash. every year, the average american produces nearly 1,600 pounds of trash, most of which still goes to landfills. although we're recycling more and more, there's an even more effective way to cut down on excess waste. simply stated, prevent it. the key to any successful waste reduction practice is thinking ahead and determining the necessity of what you are generating. the following reduction tips are designed to reduce the amount of office waste that otherwise would have to be recycled, burned, or landfilled. many things used during the work day are designed to be thrown out after one or more uses, such as paper or polystyrene cups, paper towels, pens and pencils. products that last less than three years, called nondurable goods, comprise 27 percent of the waste stream. disposables constitute a significant portion of these goods. by using items that can be refilled or reused instead of thrown away, offices will not only help to eliminate unnecessary trash, but can save money. many of these strategies require changes in current purchasing criteria as well as changes in behavior. while cost is a major consideration in purchasing decisions, product durability, repairability, and length of warranty and service contracts must also be taken into account. a product that lasts 20 years instead of 10 produces half the waste and saves money. by not creating waste in the first place - in the form of disposable products or unnecessary packaging - we don't just avoid having to send it to the local landfill. we also avoid expending the energy, consuming the natural resources, and creating the pollution that comes from making it in the first place. so when you're shopping, choose products that you can use over and over again and avoid excess packaging. it is estimated that by 2010, united states residents will be generating about 280 million tons of waste per year. approximately one-third of our waste is generated by businesses, such as offices, restaurants, and retail stores. the amount of office waste can be lowered through "source reduction," that is, by using less and thereby reducing the amount of material thrown out every day. source: inform located in: corporation yard office hours: monday - friday, 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. saturday and sunday, closed
