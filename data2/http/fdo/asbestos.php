asbestos is a mineral fiber that occurs naturally in rock and soil. asbestos fibers are very strong and heat resistant, which made its use ideal for insulation, fire proofing and sound protection. archeological evidence suggests that it has been in use since 2500 b.c. it’s mining and use grew exponentially during the industrial era of the 1800s and continued through world war ii. because of its many useful properties and relatively low production cost, asbestos was used in a wide range of manufactured goods, mostly in building materials (roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, paper products, and asbestos cement products), and friction products (automobile clutch, brake, and transmission parts), heat-resistant fabrics, packaging, gaskets, and coatings. in the 1960s, it was discovered that asbestos was carcinogenic and directly caused serious disease. the three major health effects associated with long-term asbestos exposure are: because of these health risks, some asbestos usage, but not all, was outlawed in 1978. here's a list of banned and non-banned asbestos products . in accordance with section 25915 of the california health and safety code we are providing notice that the following buildings were built prior to 1978 and therefore may contain asbestos: the most common materials where asbestos might be found in these buildings are: as long as the materials are in good condition there is no concern about exposure to the asbestos fibers within them. asbestos is potentially hazardous only when it is friable—meaning it can be easily crumbled. friable asbestos materials can become airborne and are therefore an inhalation hazard. with that in mind, demolish, pulverize, abrade, drill, scrape or otherwise disturb potentially asbestos containing materials. sjsu has developed a comprehensive to ensure that any asbestos containing building materials are properly maintained and won’t become airborne. if you notice building materials that have been damaged or are in crumbling condition at 408-924-1969 or matt.nymeyer@sjsu.edu . ehs will do a hazard assessment and arrange for remediation, if necessary. located in: corporation yard office hours: monday - friday, 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. saturday and sunday, closed
