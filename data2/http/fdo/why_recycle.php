like all state facilities in california, san jose state university was required under assembly bill (ab) 75 to reduce by 50 percent the amount of trash discarded from our campus by the end of 2004. beyond complying with the mandate, recycling is beneficial because it conserves valuable natural resources, reduces energy consumption in the manufacturing of goods, creates jobs, stimulates business development, extends the life of landfills, and reduces disposal costs. facilities development and operations (fdo) is responsible for ensuring that san jose state meets the diversion requirements established by the state, and is dedicated to making recycling and waste diversion practices on campus as easy as possible. if you have comments or suggestions on how to improve the university's recycling efforts, we welcome your feedback at recycle@sjsu.edu . the results are clear, recycling provides cleaner air and water, less pollution, more forested land and open space, and reduced greenhouse gases. located in: corporation yard office hours: monday - friday, 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. saturday and sunday, closed
