clean polystyrene packing peanuts are accepted by sjsu's shipping department where they are reused to pack items for mailing. packing peanuts can be taken directly to the shipping department or sent to them through inter-campus mail. peanuts should be sealed in a plastic bag or securely taped cardboard box for inter-campus mailing, and indicated on the outside that the contents are packing peanuts. you may also request a pickup of the peanuts by recycling/moving services via an iservice request or call 924-1990. the peanuts should be contained in a bag or box prior to the pickup. please do not return foam packing blocks to the shipping department. these are not reused, nor are they easily recyclable, and therefore should be placed in the regular trash for disposal. the plastic loose fill council's peanut hotline (800-828-2214) will direct you to businesses willing to accept used peanuts for their own packaging needs. the collection sites are typically small packaging or gift shops that welcome the free packing material. source: plastic loose fill council located in: corporation yard office hours: monday - friday, 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. saturday and sunday, closed
