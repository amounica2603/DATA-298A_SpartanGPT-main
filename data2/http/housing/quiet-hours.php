as a part of san jos√© state university, uhs is an extension of the academic environment that exists on campus. to support this living and learning environment, the following quiet hours are enforced:  quiet hours are extended to 24 hours during final exams. during quiet hours, noise should not be heard between the cva or cvb apartments, between bedrooms, or between the common areas and the bedrooms - to the extent that is humanly possible, given the community design of the facilities. quiet hours apply to the entire complex, including the grounds. during quiet hours, noise, conversations, or music from the grounds should not be heard by residents or disturb residents in their bedrooms or apartment. courtesy hours are in effect 24 hours a day, seven days a week. during these times, residents may play their music and talk in the hallways. however, any resident may request that another resident or group of residents cease any activity, which is interfering with their ability to study, rest, or enjoy the community. at these times, academic and health considerations are the priority. audible amplification (electrical or otherwise) of any musical instrument is not permitted within the residence halls or the cva or cvb apartments. headphones are recommended when using equipment that may be disruptive to others. with the exception of uhs-sponsored or approved events, noise, or music, activities on uhs grounds should not be so loud as to disrupt other residents. music should not be played at a level where it disturbs other residents. stereo equipment and speakers are expected to be of a size and power that are appropriate for high-density community living. university housing staff may request that stereos or other devices that pose a repeated disruption be removed from uhs facilities. within an apartment, or on a floor, residents may agree to extend quiet hours. floors that choose to designate extended quiet hours must post these hours clearly in the lobby of that floor. cva is an intensive academic community. residents who do not adhere to this policy may be relocated to another building or removed from housing. mon - fri 8:00am-5:00pm pst
