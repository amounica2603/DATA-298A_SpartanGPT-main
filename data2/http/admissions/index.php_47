for each admission cycle, all applicants for transfer will be required to complete an sjsu-specific supplemental application including grades for all coursework completed to meet the requirements for admission for that term. for example: because sjsu is impacted in every major, we need applicants to provide details and verify information about their academic records that is specific to sjsu’s admission process. sjsu will not consider new or changed information entered in your cal state apply application after it was submitted during the initial filing period. we plan to assign the supplemental application in early january 2023 for the fall 2023 term. students will have until january 27, 2023 to complete and submit the application. any transfer applicant who wishes to be considered for admission to sjsu must complete and submit the supplemental application by the deadline posted to their mysjsu "to do list". applicants who do not complete the sjsu-specific supplemental application by the deadline will have their application for admission withdrawn and they will have to apply to the next available term. for more information about the way that this information will be considered for admission and a list of major-specific coursework, please see the program specific supplemental coursework section. questions about the supplemental application can be answered by consulting our help guide . interested in applying to an undergraduate program or visiting campus, visit our undergraduate student outreach and recruitment office website . interested in applying to a graduate program or have questions about applying, visit our graduate enrollment management office website . 408-283-7500 monday to friday 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. (icon at the bottom right corner) monday - friday, 9 a.m. - 12 noon and 2 - 4 p.m. bachelor's degrees and undergraduate admissions only join the queue to speak with us virtually! due to a high volume of emails currently, please expect delays admissions@sjsu.edu student services center (ssc) one washington square san josé, ca 95192 san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0016 san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0017
