all majors at sjsu are impacted for transfers, meaning that all applicants compete for space in the major, based on the applicant's cumulative gpa for all transferable courses completed at the time of application.* in addition, all transfer applicants that applied during the priority application period must have submitted sjsu's supplemental application to be considered for spring 2022 admission. for spring 2022, based on self-reported grade point average (gpa) (as submitted on sjsu's supplemental application) and offer admission to applicants in sufficient numbers to meet that individual major's capacity. please note that sjsu did not consider any updates made to your calstateapply application after submission. additional preference was given to local applicants through a .25 gpa increase for those applicants who earned the majority of their transferable units at the time of application from a santa clara or santa cruz county college. please continue to check your mysjsu account for updates to your admission status and messages posted about our progress in our admission process. additional details about requirements to maintain eligibility to enroll are included in your admission materials. applicants in this category include: applicants in this category include: *some sjsu programs gave preference to transfer applicants who completed program-specific preparatory courses . please see the section below for the impaction results for those majors. for these majors, applicants were ranked on a combination of the self-reported gpa and coursework
