sjsu’s strategic plan, ​ transformation 2030 ​, calls upon the campus to “gain a national and global reputation for academic excellence characterized by scholarly and professional contributions from faculty members who are genuine teacher-scholars.” to make this possible, we have developed five broad hiring themes that enable us to say, “the future of california starts here.” the following themes were developed from the hiring requests made by the departments during the three-year hiring planning process. these themes focus on core campus strengths while meeting critical need areas in particular disciplines, and are cross-cut by our commitment to recruiting and retaining highly diverse tenure-track faculty. we look forward to welcoming new faculty in the coming years whose work connects to these critical themes that showcase how sjsu is developing a national and global reputation for research excellence.    phone: 408-924-2400 email: provost@sjsu.edu clark hall 552 one washington square san josé, ca 95192-0020
