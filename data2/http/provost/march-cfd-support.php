what plans can you make in advance to take care of parents, partners, children or other relatives? if you are a parent, what will you do if your child(ren)’s school or care center closes temporarily? thinking through these questions before and during times of uncertainty can help us act decisively and effectively. in the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), you may need to teach remotely, and/or you may need to grant flexibility in mode of instruction for students who must take care of themselves or other family members. in many cases, your first and best resource regarding your instructional assignment will be your department chair or program director; however, please know that cfd, ecampus, university personnel, and other offices are available to answer your questions. be sure to follow public health department recommendations, including respiratory hygiene etiquette such as handwashing, covering your coughs or sneezes, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. attend to messages sent via alertsjsu. consider bookmarking sjsu's covid-19 updates and advisories , and faq websites. you may also find it helpful to follow updates from santa clara county's department of public health . to the extent that is practical and appropriate for your course, try to build in grace for students. take time now to consult with colleagues about how you can maintain a fair and equitable learning environment for students in remote and/or online modes of instruction. as cfd director, i am happy to serve as a resource to you and your department chair in interpreting university policies, including serving as a sounding board about whether and how to change the mode of instruction for a course, how to maintain fairness or adapt grading in light of student absences, and how to develop/adapt a communication plan. our ecampus colleagues have prepared remote teaching resources , including workshops on leveraging canvas and zoom. ecampus instructional designers would be happy to answer your questions about moving materials into virtual mode in the event that you and your chair agree such a move is warranted. taking care to share it with them via multiple modes. how will you communicate with your students?
