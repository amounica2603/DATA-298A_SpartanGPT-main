the spartan east side promise program (sesp) is san jose state university's dedicated support service for east side union high school district students from the time of college exploration through college graduation. within student outreach and recruitment (soar), the spartan east side promise program is designed to support east side union high school district students and their families. established in 2016, the spartan east side promise (sesp) began as a collaboration between san josé state university and east side union high school district (esuhsd) with the goal of offering guaranteed admission to qualified students who graduate from an sesp eligible high school in the district . through a variety of interactive programming, the sesp provides a pathway to admission at sjsu by clearly specifying the admission requirements and sharing information about resources for academic success with students and families in the district. in 2019, the promise began to expand into a program within soar that focuses on helping incoming esuhsd students transition to sjsu, build connections, and navigate the university. our vision is to collaborate with the campus community on interactive, intentional programming to foster academic, personal, and professional development, and a college going mindset, in esuhsd students. email sesp program lead, amanda aldama fernandes at eastsidepromise@sjsu.edu or schedule a pre-admissions counseling appointment through the below link.  andrew p. hill high school w.c. overfelt high school evergreen valley high school yerba buena high school independence high school calero high school james lick high school foothill high school mt. pleasant high school accel middle college oak grove high school apollo high school piedmont hills high school pegasus high school santa teresa high school phoenix high school silver creek high school college connection academy* email eastsidepromise@sjsu.edu to schedule an admissions/spartan east side promise presentation for your class or organization. phone: 408-924-2564 phone: 408-924-2786 : outreach@sjsu.edu @futurespartans @sjsu_sesp student services center (ssc) student outreach and recruitment san josé state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0014
