academic advising is a critical piece of the experience for our students as it allows them to develop meaningful relationships with our faculty outside of the classroom, utilize campus resources and opportunities to enhance their goals, and stay on track to persist through our program. students who are currently enrolled in the counselor education department should plan to meet with their advsior at least once per semester. if you are unsure who your advisor is, please call the counselor education department office at 408-924-3634. - lorri.capizzi@sjsu.edu - 408.924.3829 - sweeney hall (sh) 420 - kyoungmi.choi@sjsu.edu - 408.924.3511 - sweeney hall (sh) 416 - dolores.mena@sjsu.edu - 408.924.3627 - sweeney hall (sh) 418 - xiaolu.hu@sjsu.edu - 408.924.3668 - sweeney hall (sh) 417 - jlaker.sjsu@gmail.com - 408.924.3654 - sweeney hall (sh) 405 - zachary.mcniece@sjsu.edu - sweeney hall (sh) 423 - aubrey.uresti@sjsu.edu - 408.924.3633 - sweeney hall (sh) 419 sjsu department of counselor education sweeney hall 404 one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0073 mondays: 8am-12pm, 1-5pm tuesdays: 8am-12pm, 1-5pm wednesdays: 8am-12pm, 1-5pm thursdays: 8am-12pm, 1-5pm fridays: available by phone or email
