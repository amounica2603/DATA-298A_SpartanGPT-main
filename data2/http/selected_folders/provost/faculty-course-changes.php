date: march 6, 2020 to: faculty from: vincent j. del casino, jr., provost and senior vp of academic affairs dear colleagues, it has come to our attention that faculty are voluntarily opting to move some or all of their courses online. moving a course online is similar to moving a face-to-face one from mw to tth. this cannot be done without the permission of your dean's office. there are currently no reported cases of covid-19 on our campus. the santa clara county health department does not recommend closure for institutions such as ours. we therefore need your help in managing this evolving public health situation by continuing to teach your courses in the manner for which they are designed. exceptions are made on a case-by-case basis. faculty who have documented health concerns may receive an accommodation through the employment accommodations resource center. we know the situation will continue to evolve and we will be sure to keep you updated as we learn more from santa clara county health department and cdc. thanks, vin phone: 408-924-2400 email: provost@sjsu.edu clark hall 552 one washington square san jos√©, ca 95192-0020
