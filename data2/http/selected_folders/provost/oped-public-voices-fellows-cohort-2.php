the office of the provost is proud to continue its partnership with the esteemed op-ed project , which aims to amplify expert voices that have been underrepresented in efforts to address today’s most pressing issues. fellows work with experienced journalists to learn what makes an idea contagious in the public sphere and how to frame ideas in ways that will have public impact. the second cohort of public voices fellows has had tremendous success, publishing 26 op-eds to date in key venues such as newsweek, the san francisco chronicle, ms. magazine, the hill reporter, san jose mercury news, cnn, and more. most notably, in the month of november 2021, sjsu’s public voice fellows have published eight op-eds, exceeding the project’s stated targets. in so doing, they have tied their peers at yale university in being the highest-producing fellowship in the current portfolio. sjsu is unique in opening this professional development opportunity not only to faculty but also to staff; collectively, these colleagues bring a wide range of interests and areas of expertise. ericka adams, justice studies anuradha basu, global innovation and leadership kirsten brandt, film and theatre étienne brown, philosophy akilah carter-francique, institute for the study of sport, society, and social change kyoung mi choi, counselor education denise dawkins, nursing marcelle dougan, public health and recreation funie hsu, humanities faith kirk, english and comparative literature maría ledesma, educational leadership robert marx, child and adolescent development eduardo muñoz-muñoz, teacher education lilly pinedo gangai, chicanx/latinx student success center laxmi ramasubramanian, urban and regional planning joanne rondilla, sociology and interdisciplinary social sciences lisa simpson, special education janet stemwedel, philosophy ching ching tan, communication studies katrina tran, college of social sciences chelsea thompto, art and art history claudio vera sanchez, justice studies yolanda wiggins, sociology and interdisciplinary social sciences erlinda yañez, chicana and chicano studies we look forward to seeing what they achieve individually and together! you can learn more about the public voices fellowship, including the many accomplishments of the inaugural cohort, at this link .  phone: 408-924-2400 email: provost@sjsu.edu clark hall 552 one washington square san josé, ca 95192-0020
