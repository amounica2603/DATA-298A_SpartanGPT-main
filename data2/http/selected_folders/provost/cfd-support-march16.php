to: faculty from: deanna fassett, director, center for faculty development hi all, i hope you know that your colleagues in the center for faculty development and ecampus have been thinking about you this week. these are strange days, and however you are feeling—whether worried, anxious, purpose-driven, or some combination—you're in good company. we have your back, we're here for you, and you and your students are not alone. here i'd like to highlight three opportunities for virtual, but nonetheless real, community in the week ahead: our faculty remote teaching experts will be holding open meetings each day this week where you are welcome to pop in to say hello, check in with colleagues from across the campus, and talk about how the move into remote modes of instruction is going for you--the highs and the lows. here are the days/times and zoom links: this is a space for parents (faculty and staff) to discuss working from home while their children are present, working from sjsu while their children are at home, and other challenges and opportunities associated with working and parenting in a time of social distance. we'll meet on thursday from 12-1 via zoom . we have 12 consultants who are not only skilled with tools that can help you and your students learn meaningful lessons from a distance, but also good at helping others learn those tools. you can arrange an individual appointment , or you can arrange a session on behalf of your department, coordinated course, or other grouping of colleagues. whether you're having trouble deciding where to start or you would like to troubleshoot a specific challenge, the consultants are eager to help. and, finally, until we're advised otherwise, you can visit the instructional resources center to meet face to face with cfd and ecampus staff members and/or use our faculty computer lab. while we're generally here from 9 am to 5 pm, we can always make arrangements for someone to arrive early or stay late if you need assistance—just let us know by emailing cfd and ecampus . you would also be very welcome to follow cfd on facebook and twitter . here is a concise listing of resources to support your remote instruction prepared by bethany winslow, one of sjsu's awesome ecampus instructional designers. all of our colleagues in ecampus have been quietly building out what is arguably the best set of instructional continuity resources in the csu system, and i can see firsthand how hard they've been working to support sjsu faculty and students. while these are challenging times, they are also heartening: together we are spartan strong. take care, deanna phone: 408-924-2400 email: provost@sjsu.edu clark hall 552 one washington square san josé, ca 95192-0020
