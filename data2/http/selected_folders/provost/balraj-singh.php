business administration, concentration in accounting lucas college and graduate school of business after taking a small business accounting class in community college, i knew that it was something i wanted to pursue. i then decided upon majoring in accounting because i enjoyed dealing with numbers, their relationships, reading company’s financial reports, and analyzing data. i like how accounting helps determine the efficiency of a business, its uniqueness and has presented me with a lot more knowledge than i had coming into the program. it means a lot to me since i am the first generation in my family to go to college. those awards helped me develop more self-confidence and made me believe i can do even greater things. my family has had the greatest influence on my life. they have supported me from the beginning and provided me with everything that i needed in order to graduate from sjsu. in addition, most of the sjsu professors played a big role in my academic success. i learned something new from most of them as they were caring and always willing to help me out. during my junior year of high school, i came to the u.s. it was hard for me to study and communicate with others because english was not my first language. however, i did not give up and i learned a lot after making some friends, organizing study groups, and attending tutoring sessions. i received two honors certificates in high school in esl & math which motivated me to do even better in university. i would tell other students to continue pushing even when it gets hard because you can achieve anything if you put your mind and heart to it. whether you're doing it for your family or for yourself, getting an education will be very helpful in the long run as it could land you a good job leading to a bright future. a spartan is a motivated and well-disciplined person. throughout my whole education years, i have been this person whether it was in class or out. even though english is my second language, i studied hard for my classes and maintained deadlines. i rarely missed a class and always tried to be on time. in addition, i have the courage to face challenges in my life. i always do my best to deal with any obstacles that come my way and face them head-on in order to be a stronger person. associate dean, lucas college and graduate school of business phone: 408-924-2400 email: provost@sjsu.edu clark hall 552 one washington square san josé, ca 95192-0020
