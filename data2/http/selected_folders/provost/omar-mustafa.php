business administration/management lucas college and graduate school of business i chose my major because i believed it would open up the most doors for me after i graduated. i also love working with people, and that is practically all you do in business. this award means everything to me. i had made the dean's list several times before, but the president’s award always eluded me. i made it my mission to get the award about a year ago and dedicated a lot of time and effort into that pursuit. it’s amazing to see all that hard work pay off. my mother and father have been equally important influencers of my life. their unconditional love and support has always helped me overcome the obstacles a student inevitably faces, and i couldn’t be more grateful for them. in regards to the members of sjsu’s faculty that helped me reach this point, i honestly can’t give one answer. every teacher i’ve had has pushed me and motivated me in a way, and it wouldn’t feel right to give one person a moment of glory when they’ve all made positive contributions. when i entered college, my father told me that school would now be my full time job. taking these words to heart, i made it a point to be as hard working, professional, and respectful to others as possible. developing this mentality, helped me focus more in class. if i wouldn’t slack off in a real work setting, then i had no excuse to slack off in school. take it seriously, and never blame your professors when you do poorly in a class. it’s a lot easier to alleviate the stresses that come with school if you take accountability for your actions. instead of spending hours fuming about how a professor “wronged” you, ask yourself if you truly deserved to get the grade you wanted, and make it your mission to do better when you get another chance. as corny as it sounds, i kind of developed a “warrior’s mentality” at san jose state. my experiences at this school have taught me that no task is too difficult, and that every obstacle you face can, and will be accomplished. i also learned that if i put my head down and work hard, no one can top me. a mentality i hope a lot of other people develop. professor, management "omar has a positive personality and an open and sharing nature. he was always willing to learn from his own personal experiences and apply the lessons learned to future challenges." professor, management phone: 408-924-2400 email: provost@sjsu.edu clark hall 552 one washington square san josé, ca 95192-0020
