 san jose state university understands that faculty success leads to greater student success. we are proud to be a hispanic serving institution (hsi) and asian american and native american pacific islander (aanapisi) serving institution. many of our 36,000 students are historically underserved, the first in their families to pursue post-secondary degrees, and pell recipients. we seek to recruit faculty who reflect the increasing diversity of our students. sjsu requires a diversity statement from faculty applicants because we are interested in understanding the lived and professional experiences and commitment you may bring to our campus community. as we seek to create a welcoming, equitable, and inclusive campus climate for all, we see this statement as a tool that can help you explain the value you might add to this endeavor. strong diversity statements (suggested length of 2 pages) will discuss the following: how do you think about diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging? what factors influence underrepresented groups in academia, and the experiences of individuals from particular groups within academia? have you been involved in activities to advance or promote a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment or institution? such activities could be large and organized or they could be specific and personal. please tell us the role that you played, what you did, what happened, and what you learned from the experience. coming into a new institution will involve significant change. please let us know how you plan to integrate deib into your faculty role, including new or existing initiatives you would like to be involved with. this rubric [pdf] provides information on how the diversity statement will be evaluated by the search committee.   phone: 408-924-2400 email: provost@sjsu.edu clark hall 552 one washington square san jos√©, ca 95192-0020
