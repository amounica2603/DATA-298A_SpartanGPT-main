not all dishwashing soap is the same. make sure to use only . regular dish soap, laundry detergent, shampoo, and liquid dish soap will create excess suds and flood the kitchen floor.   before closing the door, make sure dishwasher isnâ€™t overloaded. improper loading will result in dishes not being cleaned. the dishwasher connects to sink drain pipes that do not have disposals. anything that comes off of the dirty dishes can clog the sink or vice versa. please be aware that all food particles should be washed off or thrown away before placing the dishes in the dishwasher. if dishes are brand new, please remove all tags or labels that are stuck on the dishes because the wet paper will clog the drain. if large pans or larger dishes are placed at the bottom of the dishwasher they will block the water spray and dishes will not be cleaned properly. ** hint: 1 cup of vinegar in the bottom of dishwasher will help reduce the soap suds.  mon - fri 8:00am-5:00pm pst
