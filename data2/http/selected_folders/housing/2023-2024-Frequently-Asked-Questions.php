(see section 9a and b). the license agreement is for the entire academic year (mid-august to–mid-may, excluding winter break, for the suites, classics and cv2; mid-august to the second to last weekend of may for the apartments). refer to the license agreement booklet for exact dates. students who have applied for spring semester only are responsible for the entire spring semester (mid-january to mid-may for the suites, classics and cv2; january 1st to the second to last weekend of may for the apartments). refer to license agreement booklet for exact dates. students may not break the housing license agreement unless they meet the criteria for cancellation. please read your license materials carefully before signing the license agreement. the initial payment is $300.00 and required to complete the housing application.  all housing applicants, even financial aid recipients, are expected to pay the initial housing payment out of pocket. online housing application, electronically signed license agreement, $50 non-refundable application fee, and initial housing payment must be submitted in full before your housing application can be considered for an assignment. reductions and/or waivers for the initial housing payment are not available. keep in mind that the initial housing payment is actually a pre-payment of a portion of your fall housing charges (or spring charges if you are a new spring applicant). it is applied directly to the housing fees and board charges. it is not a deposit since you do not get this back at the end of the academic year. please note that the initial housing payment is only needed with each new academic year housing application (or new spring only application). if you apply for the academic year 2023/2024 and move in for the fall 2023 semester, you only need to submit one initial housing payment with your 2023/2024 application to cover both fall and spring semesters. an additional initial housing payment is not needed for the spring semester (unless completing a spring only application) if you are already contracted for the academic year. it is very rare that a student will receive enough grants and loans to pay 100% of their tuition, housing fees and board, therefore all students must be prepared to pay a portion of their fees. if you are receiving more financial aid than your semester charges, the excess will be refunded directly to you, after your financial aid has been applied to your account and paid all university fees owed. more information regarding refunds can be found below. remember that the initial housing payment is a pre-payment that is applied toward your fall housing charges (or spring charges if you are a new spring applicant). the initial housing payment is paid through the university housing application portal while completing your online housing application. during the application process, you will be redirected to a secure payment website, cashnet, to remit the $50 non-refundable application fee and the initial housing payment. semester payment due dates can be found on the housing website. below is the link to the semester payment due dates which include the housing installment payment plan (ipp) payment due dates: https://www.sjsu.edu/housing/apply-for-housing/payments.php university housing services does not send out paper bills or invoices. university housing services will bill your mysjsu account http://one.sjsu.edu/ following your room assignment. it is the responsibility of the resident to make payment by the scheduled due dates. residents may not receive an advance reminder notice of payment due date. failure to make payment by the specified dates will result in a hold on all sjsu records and services. all payments must be received in the uhs office by the specified due date or a $75 late fee will be assessed to the resident’s mysjsu account. late fees will continue to be assessed each month the account is delinquent. you will be advised to enroll in the housing installment payment plan (ipp). depending on the date that you sign up, this will divide your semester charges into installments to allow smaller monthly payments instead of one larger semester payment. the housing ipp is available by signing up on your mysjsu account. please be aware that residents will have two different installment plans to choose from. there is one for housing and one for tuition. you may select either or both. the ipp is effective for that semester only and must be re-selected at the start of each semester. please note that residents who elect to enroll in the housing installment payment plan (ipp) to pay their fees in installments will be charged an additional non-refundable fee of $35.00 for this plan each semester. once you have already enrolled in the housing installment payment plan, under extenuating circumstances, you may request an extension from the housing resident accounts coordinator. requests are subject to resident accounts coordinator approval, and are granted only on a case by case basis. financial aid will be disbursed directly to student’s mysjsu account, and applied to registration fees first. any remaining financial aid will be applied to housing charges. to see if you qualify for a housing extension, answer the questions listed below: if the answers to all three questions are "yes" then you are eligible for a housing extension. if the answer to any of the above three questions is "no", then a housing extension cannot be approved at this time and you will need to seek other methods to pay your campus debt. to verify if you have an approved housing extension, navigate to your mysjsu account and look under the "other indicators" section located on the right hand side of your student center page (the main page). if you have an approved housing extension, it will be found here along with an end date. any remaining balance on your account past the housing extension end date will need to be paid immediately. you may contact the housing cashier in the uhs housing main office to verify the specific payment due date if you are unsure. the first housing extensions will be placed after semester housing charges have been uploaded to the student accounts, approximately june 26, 2023 for the fall semester, and november 29, 2023 for the spring semester. student loans cannot be "accepted", or included in the financial aid award package until on or after june 1. if you plan to accept any loans offered, you must log into your mysjsu account on or immediately after june 1 to accept the loans. if you are a new sjsu spring semester only student, or are just now applying for a loan for the spring semester, those loans may be "accepted" immediately upon offer date, there is no waiting period for them. financial aid may be delayed for a number of reasons, please visit the financial aid office website and review the seven steps to financial aid if you have questions about your award. if you are receiving $14,000 or more in financial aid, you qualify for the housing extension and most likely already have both the housing extension and tuition fee deferral on your account. verify this information on your mysjsu account under “other indicators”. note the end dates of these payment extensions/deferrals. balances remaining on your account past the end dates will be due on the next payment due date. you must pay your housing charges in full by the payment due date, or enroll in the housing installment payment plan (ipp) which is detailed below. you do not qualify for the housing extension, but if you are receiving some financial aid you probably have the tuition fee deferral on your account. verify this information on your mysjsu account under “other indicators”. if you have the tuition fee deferral, but not the housing extension, only your registration fees are deferred. please note that by enrolling in the housing ipp, you must pay the full amount of each installment in its entirety on or before the payment due dates, even if you have the tuition fee deferral. if an installment is unpaid, partially paid, or paid late you may be subject to late fees and holds on your account. you can enroll in the housing installment payment plan (ipp) which is explained in further detail below. you can also contact the financial aid office to discuss options of financial aid that may be available to you. the housing resident accounts coordinator is available to review any additional options with you. if you have a balance on your account after your financial aid has been disbursed and you cannot pay the balance all at once, you can enroll in the housing installment payment plan (ipp) to help break up the payments. please note that depending on when you enroll in the housing ipp will depend on how many installments are available to you. see below for more information on the housing ipp. the housing ipp is the only housing payment plan available to students. by enrolling in the housing ipp your housing charges will be divided into installments. the number of installments depends on how soon you enroll in the housing ipp. there are a total of four possible installments each semester (fall and spring). we encourage you to sign up as soon as the option is available in late june so you can take advantage of all four installments for fall, and mid-january for spring. depending on your financial aid award, you may want to consider enrolling in the housing ipp. although you may have a tuition fee deferral for your registration fees and a housing extension for your housing charges, as soon as your financial aid is disbursed to your mysjsu account, you must pay the remaining balance immediately after the housing extension end date if you are not enrolled in the housing ipp. unpaid balances may be subject to late fees and holds on your account. housing charges are uploaded to your mysjsu account and due on the same date as the campus registration fee due dates. the first payment due date for the fall semester is july 15, 2023, for the spring semester it is january 16, 2024. if you are unable to pay your entire semester housing charges by july 15, 2023 for fall or january 16, 2024 for spring, then you may want to select the housing ipp, even if you are receiving financial aid. the housing ipp is semester specific meaning that if you enroll in it for the fall semester, it does not automatically enroll you for the spring semester. you will have to enroll in the housing ipp again for the spring semester separately once the spring housing charges are uploaded to your mysjsu account. please note that residents who elect to enroll in the housing installment payment plan (ipp) to pay their fees in installments will be charged an additional non-refundable fee of $35.00 for this plan each semester. if you have a large balance remaining after your financial aid is applied, this balance may be divided into installments to allow you to make smaller payments over a period of time. depending on when you enroll in the housing ipp will depend on how many payments your balance will be broken up into. keep in mind that making changes, such as adding, cancelling or changing your meal plan and adding or cancelling a campus village parking permit after the start of the housing ipp, may readjust payment amounts and due dates and the final housing ipp may not result in equal payment amounts on each housing ipp due date. the final housing ipp due date, regardless of how the amounts are divided, is early october (for fall) and early april (for spring). for step by step instructions on how to enroll in the housing ipp follow these instructions: https://www.sjsu.edu/bursar/docs/steps/enroll_ipp_housing_only.pdf [pdf] you can enroll in the housing ipp once you have the semester charges uploaded on your mysjsu account. if you enroll in the housing ipp and charges are added after you enroll, or there are any other adjustments made to your account, the amounts of the installments will be adjusted to reflect these additional charges. uhs will generate a refund under the following conditions: by signing up for direct deposit (electronic refunds), you give the university permission to deposit any refunds or financial aid disbursements directly to your personal bank account. we recommend enrolling in direct deposit since it is more secure and you will receive your refund faster. you may sign up for direct deposit by navigating to your mysjsu student center and following the instructions on how to enroll in direct deposit if you don't enroll in direct deposit, it can take 4 to 6 weeks to receive a refund check. refunds are processed throughout the semester. a student does not need to submit a request to receive a refund. refunds due to financial aid disbursements in excess of charges on a student's account are issued to students when there is a credit balance on a student's account, per standard processing schedules. refunds for payments made on student accounts other than financial aid are processed throughout the semester, after the add/drop period has ended. students are responsible for their own accounts. if students choose to do so, they may authorize a parent user to discuss financial information regarding their accounts. information regarding a student’s account cannot be given out to anyone other than the student unless the student has identified an authorized parent user through the housing application portal and accessing their housing application. the information allowed to be given to authorized parent users is restricted to only financial information due to the family educational rights and privacy act (ferpa). below is a link to more information regarding ferpa as well as a link on how to add an authorized parent user to a student’s account.
