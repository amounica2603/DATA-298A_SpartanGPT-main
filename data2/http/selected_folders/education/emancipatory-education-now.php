emancipatory education now is a student-led initiative at the sjsu lurie college of education that examines what emancipatory education – the critical evaluation of the systems and structures of oppression that maintain the status quo in our educational institutions – looks like in today’s society and advocates for the expansion of emancipatory education research, policies, and practices. in this episode, you can learn more about our student co-hosts - abby, aminah, ana, vaishnavi, and victor - through their name stories. they also share a preview of some of the topics they plan to discuss in more detail later this semester. the call to action for this episode: exchange your name story with a family member, friend, colleague, or classmate! additional resources shared in this episode include: - asher, n. (2009) decolonization and education: locating pedagogy and self at the interstices in global times - the four i's of oppression in this episode, victor leads a dialogue around decolonization in education. the co-hosts shared their insights framed by questions such as: - what is your initial reaction towards the reading? do you have an example or question that came to mind after reading the article? - how would you describe the topic of decolonization to a student? - what would efforts to decolonize education look like? after reading the article “decolonization and education: locating pedagogy and self at the interstices in global times” by nina asher prior to the episode. this episode’s call to action: the effects of colonization can be experienced by the narrow thinking developed in the human mind. as we return to society, we must be more mindful in how we interact with each other. decolonization begins with decolonizing one’s own mind. in this episode, aminah leads a dialogue around high-stakes standardized testing. the co-hosts shared their insights framed by questions such as: - what are your initial reactions to this reading? do you have any examples or questions that came to mind after the reading? - how do you think standardized testing practices racial inequality and who do you think it affects the most? - how can we support students who are affected by the inequalities of standardized testing, when these practices are still in place? - what are possible standardized testing alternatives you would implement/want to see implemented in schools that would achieve racial equality and be accurate measures of a students knowledge? or is this something we even need to measure? after reading the article " meritocracy 2.0: high-stakes, standardized testing as a racial project of neoliberal multiculturalism " by wayne au prior to the episode. this episode's call to action: raise our awareness of how biases in standardized testing affect our students in order to provide support for students who are affected by these biases and find ways to help them succeed. in this episode, vaishnavi leads a dialogue around inequality and access in education. the co-hosts shared their insights framed by questions such as: - what are some examples of initiatives at the classroom, school/university, state, or federal level that have been effective at creating a more equitable education for low income students? what are some examples of ineffective initiatives or missed opportunities? - how do you think race plays a factor in schooling in low income communities? the videos provided some examples. did anything stand out to you? - in the crash course video, we saw that higher income parents are more likely to spend time with their children reading books and strengthening their cognitive skills. these higher income children enter school with more knowledge compared to a child from a lower income household. how can we support these young children early on to ensure that they are successful throughout their school journey? - fafsa is a great way for students to get grants and money. however, do you think fafsa is a simple process for low income families? why or why not? after reading the article on the factors that count against low income students in the college admissions process, what were your thoughts/initial reactions? do you think that students that attend schools with extremely low budgets will always have no hope towards attending good colleges since they don't have impressive extracurriculars or classes? after reading the article " 5 ways elite-college admissions shut out poor kids " by anya kamenetz and watching the videos " higher education for low-income students ," and " schools & social inequality: crash course sociology #41 ." this episode's call to action: after our discussion, think about how san jose state university aids low income students to continue attending classes. find one resource that sjsu provides to support these students. do you think this resource is helpful? is there a resource that you would recommend to sjsu instead? in this episode, ana leads a dialogue around antiracist education. the co-hosts shared their insights framed by questions such as: - what was your initial reaction to the articles and the video? did anything surprise you? - how would you define antiracist education? - what do you think are antiracist strategies for teachers? do you agree with the ones presented in the video? - the first article discusses the need to go beyond ethnic studies courses and include anti-racist education in all subjects. how do you think schools and districts can accomplish this? - the second article discusses trump-era policies that sought to prevent schools from teaching critical race theory and federally funded agencies from offering diversity training. while this is no longer an issue under the biden administration, should we be concerned about such things happening in the future? what do you think is the likelihood of a future administration trying to enact such policies, and is there anything we can do about it in the meantime? - can you identify any challenges to implementing strategies for antiracist education? how can we overcome these? - why is antiracist education important to you? why do you think it’s important that schools commit to antiracist education? after reading the articles "california schools, universities condemn anti-asian attacks, offer support to students" by carolyn jones and ashley smith and "diversity work, interrupted" by colleen flaherty and watching the video "6 ways to be an antiracist educator" by edutopia. this episode's call to action: watch the video “six ways to be an antiracist educator” and try to implement at least one of those strategies in your classroom. additionally, since many of these ideas are applicable beyond the classroom, think about what it would look like for you to implement such practices in your daily life. what can you do to combat racism in your community? in this episode, abby leads a dialogue around stereotype threat. the co-hosts shared their insights framed by questions such as: - what resonated with you about this tedtalk? did anything surprise you or challenge your previous ways of thinking? - we started today’s sharing some of our layers of our identity. as you consumed adichie’s talk on single stories, what single stories were coming up for you about yourself? - in the tedtalk, adichie references an igbo word: nkali (9:37) - “to be greater than another.” she goes on to say that single stories exist because there are those who have the power to write the definitive stories of a person or group of people. our media have the power of telling the story of people. what single stories do you see in the media? - why is it important to understand the single stories of ourselves and others? why is it important for those in education to identify when single stories exist? - we also read an article on some ways to address stereotype threat in the classroom. what are your thoughts on those suggestions? is it enough? what else could be done? after watching "the danger of a single story" by chimamanda ngozi adichie and reading "how teachers can reduce stereotype threat in the classroom." this episode's call to action: how are you purposefully providing opportunities for those you influence and who influence you to give you a more complete story of who they are?
