robert marx’s community-engaged research and practice focus on reframing dominant visions of queer young people, so that they are no longer viewed as damaged or at-risk, but rather as the gifted, complex people they are. marx deploys a variety of research methods, including critical youth participatory action research and meta-analysis, to better understand and promote marginalized youth’s development. as a former high school english teacher, they approach this work from the intersection of educational studies, developmental psychology, and critical pedagogy, and his work encourages young people to see themselves as producers of knowledge and change agents. listen to robert's playlist below and access all of the personality playlists on our lurie college of education spotify account sjsu connie l. lurie college of education sweeney hall 103 one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0071 create opportunities for lurie college students!
