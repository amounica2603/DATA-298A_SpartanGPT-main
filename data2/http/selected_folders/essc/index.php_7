generally, meet with an essc advisor to have your ge courses and transfer credit summary audited. they can clear any errors (credits that did not transfer when they should have, for example) that the automated system in the evaluation's office didn't catch. , there is an important change in the college of engineering tep process. please read the details below marked generally, all information can be found in assist.org . additionally, sjsu has its own articulation page which includes options to view only ge courses or major courses ( course-to-course list ). as soon as possible. if the transfer course is a prerequisite, you will need it posted in your records before you can register for the proceeding course during advanced enrollment. otherwise, you will need to bring unofficial transcripts to the department or instructor in record to get an add code. failing to show proof or prerequisites may result in being dropped from the course. these are your options: talk to your major advisor for a substitution or a waiver. depending on the course, you might need to submit a transfer equivalency or intensive science petition. if you're unsure, make an appointment with an essc advisor for their recommendations. go to sjsu's catalog listing of ap credit by examination: 2022-2023 academic year ; 2021-2022 academic year ; 2020-2021 academic year . you will need to send your official scores from college board to sjsu to apply these credits to your account. the temporary area c waiver for 2021-2022 has been approved for our college. . during the process of transfer credit being posted and evaluated and continuous enrollment verified, evaluations will change your ge catalog year (different from the major catalog year) to fall 2020, which would keep you on the old ge pattern and not require you to take area f. transfer credit will continue to be evaluated and posted throughout the summer, so once credit has been evaluated, please refer to eval@sjsu.edu if you have the continuous enrollment but are being held to area f. read the csu policy on ge requirements . a (transfer equivalency petition) is strictly for an external course with no articulation agreement already. it is submitted by the student through the tep process, managed by the essc (see below for an important change in the process), and sent to the appropriate department. is when an advisor approves the use of one course (external credit or another sjsu course) for another sjsu course. there could be an articulation agreement, or it could be another sjsu course. only the major advisor can make a substitution. this is the more flexible option. here are some examples of substitutions: the student took an external course with no articulation agreement, but the course is very close to an sjsu required course (e.g. cis 22a from de anza for cs 46a). the student took an sjsu course from a different major, and it is close enough to the current major requirement (e.g. ae 30 for me 30). the student submitted a tep (transfer equivalency petition) which was rejected for some reason or another, and the major advisor determines that the course satisfies the major requirement (e.g. a physics course from an international university for phys 50). when in doubt, meet with your major advisor first. essc no longer processes teps for college of science courses used to meet engineering or aviation major prep requirements. please read the new! faq question below regarding college of science courses. in general we advise checking in with your major advisor to determine whether a tep is best or necessary. we also advise not signing up for courses you think you have a good chance of receiving credit for using transfer credit (especially as a new transfer student). when in doubt, meet with your major advisor first. the cmpe/se department will no longer consider petitions from students trying to substitute a lower-division course for an upper-division sjsu course. please contact the cmpe/se department if you have questions. , coe transfer equivalency petition (tep) will be used only for:  include: aerospace engineering ( ), aviation ( ), biomedical engineering ( ), chemical engineering ( ), civil engineering ( ), computer engineering ( including software engineering), electrical engineering ( ), engineering technology ( ), industrial & systems engineering ( ), interdisciplinary engineering ( ), materials engineering ( ), and mechanical engineering ( ). the sjsu course needs to have a letter prefix listed above. : engr 10, ee 98, ce 99, mate 25, tech 60, me 101, ae 20, bme 25, avia 1, ise 130, cmpe 30, me 20, ce 95 engineering or aviation students who want to request equivalency for a college of science course will use a different request, through the college of science advising center. (see the answer to the next faq, marked ) the consists of the following departments: biology, chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, meteorology, and physics. are math (all), phys (all), chem (all), cs (all), biol (all), geol 2. , engineering or aviation students who want to request equivalency for a course use this request, through the college of science advising center . it can take up to 15 working business days after you submit your request to cosac for a reply. see details on the form itself. links to the equivalency petition form can also be found on the cosac webpage , under the first letter of the subject (e.g. for chemistry, for math, for physics, etc.). anything that causes your major prep and major requirements to change in myprogress will wipe out any previous updates that were manually made. this includes a change of major or being dq'ed (i.e. enrolled in open university/continuing education instead of sjsu).  monday through friday, during business hours (closed weekends and holidays) visit office: virtually or in person at eng 116 undergraduate: success-engineering@sjsu.edu graduate: graduate-engineering@sjsu.edu appointments with advisors: spartan connect phone: 408-924-3990 all online courses at sjsu are delivered through canvas . monday through friday (except weekends and holidays), hours depending on location. : see our calendar for virtual/drop-in hours : engineering 1st floor eng 116 monday through friday 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon 1:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. (closed for lunch daily 12:00 - 1:00) in-person drop-in calendar san josé state university one washington square, san josé, ca 95192-0220
