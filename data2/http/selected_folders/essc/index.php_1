due to impaction constraints, every prospective lower division student is required to submit a change of major application for departmental review. admittance cannot be guaranteed and will depend on the applicant’s overall academic progress and performance in key engineering courses. to change your major, you must meet the major impaction criteria, apply and be accepted into the department the major resides (e.g. computer *science* is offered through the college of science, not the college of engineering). if you are interested in switching into a major within the college of engineering, check out our getting into the college of engineering (coe) page for more information. students interested in pursuing majors of the college of engineering are encouraged to meet with an advisor from the new respective major department or the corresponding student success center . if you're exploring a change of major out of engineering (e.g. you like engineering but are struggling with some of the stem coursework), here are some alternate majors that other students have found fulfilling. students who want to change their major within the college of engineering must meet eligibility requirement. check out our getting into the (coe) college of engineering page for more information. monday through friday, during business hours (closed weekends and holidays) visit office: virtually or in person at eng 116 undergraduate: success-engineering@sjsu.edu graduate: graduate-engineering@sjsu.edu appointments with advisors: spartan connect phone: 408-924-3990 all online courses at sjsu are delivered through canvas . monday through friday (except weekends and holidays), hours depending on location. : see our calendar for virtual/drop-in hours : engineering 1st floor eng 116 monday through friday 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon 1:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. (closed for lunch daily 12:00 - 1:00) in-person drop-in calendar san josé state university one washington square, san josé, ca 95192-0220
