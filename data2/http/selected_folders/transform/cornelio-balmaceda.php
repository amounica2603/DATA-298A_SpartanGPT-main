attending sjsu transformed my life in various ways. i want to start off by saying that i was never even supposed to be in college, let alone get accepted to sjsu. but the moment i stepped onto campus, everything changed for the better. i learned and acquired different skills and techniques that are relevant to my everyday life. each professor that i had the pleasure of taking had unique personalities and approaches that better improved myself as a student as well as a person. whether it was basic knowledge regarding my field of study or lessons that went beyond the classroom, i was fortunate enough to study under them. credit to all my professors who took their time with me and always made sure i was doing well. not only that, but one of the best ways sjsu transformed my life is within it, i was introduced to lifelong friends and developed many connections. i will forever cherish my days at sjsu, and because i attended there, i am a better individual. thank you sjsu!
