before graduating high school i applied to sjsu and my application unfortunately got withdrawn. i was devastated. i didn’t let that stop me though. i took a year off after graduating high school and worked to save money for college for the following year. i applied once more to sjsu in hopes that i would get accepted. a couple months later i was so excited that i had received my admission offer! i had no idea how much sjsu would transform my life. i moved to the city of san josé and built strong friendships with my peers and strong relationships with my professors. i majored in sociology and pursued a minor in chicana/o studies and felt represented and supported by staff and professors who wanted to help me succeed. i also found a community within eop that supported and mentored me to become who i am today. i was involved with organizations on campus and worked for other jobs off campus as well. i found myself becoming a part of the city of san josé. sjsu transformed me in more ways than one, but i am glad i never gave up on myself and took the opportunity to apply again because i had no idea the amazing things that were in store for me. i graduated spring 2020 and moved out of the bay area to southern california. i work as a case manager for a non profit and just accepted admission to csu northridge for a masters in social work. sjsu fostered a passion and purpose within me to help others. i will always be thankful for my life and experiences at san josé state.
