the occupational therapy department has initiated an international experience requirement for students entering the masterâ€™s degree program in occupational therapy. the overall goal for the international experience is to gain cross-cultural and cross-national insight into the political, social, cultural and economic factors that influence the provision of occupational therapy services outside of the u.s. and define the role of occupational therapy within the system of care. social and occupational justice issues are explored, and the role of the student as a global citizen is emphasized. several types of international experiences are available, including faculty-led study abroad programs and service trips that can be completed during winter or summer sessions. many of the experiences include opportunities to engage with local people in the provision of occupational therapy services. most of the experiences are interdisciplinary, allowing students to work and study with students and providers from a variety of healthcare professions. time abroad typically ranges from one to three weeks with assignments completed prior to the trip and after returning. students register for 1-6 units of coursework for the international experience. the summer 2023 schedule includes international experience in finland , vietnam and taiwan . finland: start: may 28, 2023 end: june 9, 2023 vietnam: start: june 7, 2023 end: june 21, 2023 taiwan ( ): start: june 14, 2023 end: june 28, 2023 phone: 408-924-3070 fax: 408-924-3088 email: occupationaltherapyadmin admissions information: : gradadvisor-occupationaltherapy@sjsu.edu : otdadvisor-occupationaltherapy@sjsu.edu office hours: monday -thursday friday
