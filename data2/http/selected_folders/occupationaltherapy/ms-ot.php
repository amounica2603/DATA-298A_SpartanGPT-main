the occupational therapy program at san jos√© state university is accredited by the accreditation council for occupational therapy education (acote) of the american occupational therapy association (aota). the address is 6116 executive boulevard, suite 200, north bethesda, md 20852-4929. acote's telephone number, c/o aota, is (301) 652 - aota. it is the oldest accredited occupational therapy program in the california state university system. the master of science in occupational therapy program curriculum is designed for students who have earned a baccalaureate degree in a discipline other than occupational therapy. it enables the student to obtain the education and degrees necessary to be eligible to practice as an occupational therapist. this program is offered primarily on the san jose state university campus but students will also have fieldwork and practicum experiences off campus. once the master of science degree in occupational therapy is completed, the student is eligible to sit for the national certification examination. successful completion of the examination qualifies the candidate to apply for national certification and state licensure. please check

contact the above mentioned certification and licensing boards prior to the start of the program to determine their potential to practice as an occupational therapist. while we recognize this to be a privacy issue, it is recommended that the student disclose this information to the fieldwork director before fieldwork placements are sought. the $200 enrollment deposit will be applied towards your tuition and fees once you enroll in fall 2023 classes. the curriculum is organized around the core principle of participation in occupation to promote health, well-being, and social inclusion. the curriculum is designed to enable students to acquire the knowledge and competencies necessary to become qualified as a generalist in occupational therapy practice within four semesters of graduate academic study and six months of supervised fieldwork experience. there is broad exposure to current and emerging practice areas with a wide range of populations, conditions, and ages. students receive a strong foundation in the concept of occupation early in the program and subsequent coursework is structured to provide a holistic orientation to occupational therapy practice. participation in occupation is the desired outcome for all recipients of occupational therapy services. participation in occupation is broadly defined, so courses address practice in a variety of settings, both traditional and emerging. the addition of a two-course sequence in community-based practice provides strong linkages to the local community, including programs where occupational therapy has not traditionally been available, and provides students with a variety of opportunities to engage with clients and service providers in creative problem-solving contexts. a lifespan orientation to occupational therapy practice was chosen rather than organization according to traditional practice areas in order to emphasize the holistic nature of contemporary practice. course content addressing professional behaviors and research/evidence-based practice provided throughout the curriculum assists students in advancing critical analysis and leadership skills. the curriculum supports the mission and vision of the department and the university in preparing occupational therapy leaders who serve their communities through both scholarship and practice. students in each cohort are assigned to one of two tracks for study. most courses are taken concurrently. the clinical/community practicum courses (octh 276, 234, 286) are offered in both semesters to provide continuity of services in the on-campus clinics and for the clinical and community partners. therefore, students may enroll in these courses in either the fall or spring semester, depending on the track to which they are assigned. the lifespan-based practice courses (octh 226, 236, 246, 256, 266) are designed so that they do not need to be taken in sequence. six curricular threads reflect knowledge and skills that run through all courses in the curriculum. they include the following (see curriculum threads [pdf] section below for more detail): progression and graduation requirements [pdf] all students in the ot program will be required to participate in an international experience as a part of their academic program. for students seeking an alternative to the study abroad requirement or students who have substantial international experience within 5 years of entering san jose state university please see the college of health and human sciences (chhs) website for petition forms. phone:
