: july 15, 2021 : traci ferdolage, senior associate vice president of facilities development and operations sjsu campus community, as we look forward to welcoming more students, faculty and staff to campus beginning next month, i wanted to share steps facilities development and operations (fd&o) and environmental health and safety (eh&s) are taking to keep you safe. first, to reiterate the : masks are still required regardless of vaccination status in the student wellness center and child development center. individuals are also still required to wear a mask while riding public transit. the tsa has extended its mask requirement for all transportation networks through sept 13. as a reminder, all buildings on campus are locked and require your tower id card to access buildings on campus. we realize the start of the semester is also a transitional period where many individuals may be receiving their tower id card (i.e., new faculty/staff, late student enrollees, etc.). as a result, we will ensure buildings remain unlocked for the first two weeks of the semester during times classes, programs, and activities take place. . if you do not have a tower id card, please contact the tower id card office . if your tower id card is malfunctioning, please contact the fd&o customer service center . new signage will be posted around campus regarding masking requirements for individuals who are and are not fully vaccinated. space capacity limitations and physical distancing requirements have been lifted and are no longer applicable within campus facilities. break room refrigerators, microwaves and other appliances can be used. protective supplies and equipment will be available via request using the covid-19 safety supply request form . hand sanitizer, disposable face covers and disposable gloves will also be available at supply stations located in common areas of campus buildings. protective barriers (plexiglas) will remain or continue to be placed at high traffic customer facing locations, such as service desks and checkout windows. building hvac systems have had their filtration systems modified to higher level of filtration (merv-13) and configured to maximize outside air intake to provide a greater level of fresh air to the building. we continue to work with our consulting mechanical engineer to fine tune these systems to improve safety. our custodial crew will continue cleaning spaces overnight and disinfect high touchpoint locations (handrails, bathrooms, elevator buttons, etc.). if there is a determined covid-19 positive individual who used a campus space during their infectious period, that area will be isolated until custodial staff can perform a deep cleaning and disinfection of that area. the health and safety of our campus community continues to be our top priority and we look forward to welcoming many of you back soon. sincerely, traci ferdolage senior associate vice president of facilities development and operations email: healthadvisories@sjsu.edu sign up for alert sjsu
