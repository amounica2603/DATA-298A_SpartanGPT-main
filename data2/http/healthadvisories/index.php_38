: may 19, 2021 : president mary a. papazian sjsu campus community, today, may 19, santa clara county improved from orange (tier 3 - moderate) to yellow (tier 4 - minimal) in the state of california’s four-tier color-coded tracking system . ahead of the state’s plans to fully reopen on june 15, this move to the yellow tier is a testament to the diligent care for health and safety our county has stressed since the pandemic began. coinciding with this move to the yellow tier, the santa clara county public health department has lifted most of its previous health orders and enacted a new limited local health order . the following are requirements that affect sjsu, and how the university is addressing these requirements is listed : 1. requires the collection of vaccination status of all personnel — employees, contractors, subcontractors, independent contractors, vendors, volunteers and other individuals who regularly provide services onsite at the request of a business. if an individual declines to report vaccination status, they will be considered unvaccinated. initial ascertainment of vaccination status must be completed by june 2, 2021. 2. mandates personnel immediately notify their employer if they test positive for covid-19 or are exhibiting symptoms consistent with covid-19. 3. aligns with california department of public health guidance on face coverings and masks that was updated earlier this month. we also await revised guidance from the state’s division of occupational safety and health (cal/osha) regarding workplace safety protocols. as a reminder, sjsu’s goal throughout the pandemic has been to safely repopulate the campus as state and county guidelines allow. university personnel is working with departments to finalize staffing plans ahead of july 1, 2021. as we continue to move forward with repopulating the campus, email covidrepopulation@sjsu.edu with questions you may have about the process. thank you for your continued patience and flexibility as we work to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of the covid-19 pandemic. we will continue to share updates with the campus community as they become available. sincerely, dr. mary a. papazian president email: healthadvisories@sjsu.edu sign up for alert sjsu
