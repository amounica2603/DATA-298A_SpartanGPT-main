: february 8, 2022 : interim president steve perez dear campus community, with the spring semester in full swing, we are looking forward to many returning to campus when . being together will allow us to strengthen our community by being around each other and reconnecting with those we care about and have missed. as we continue to gauge what life will look like post pandemic, being back together will give us an opportunity to build those relationships and observe the operations of the campus. we have made the decision to keep the february 14 date to return to in-person learning (with teaching modalities as posted in the class schedule) for several reasons. with cases trending down in santa clara county and the state, combined with our csu vaccination policy requiring the booster shot for our campus community, our campus continues to remain a safe space for our students, faculty and staff. we understand the concerns and trepidation many might feel as we again start to ramp up in-person interactions, and i want to assure you the health and safety of our campus community is our top priority. we will continue to keep our campus mask mandate until further notice. our testing numbers on campus have been encouraging, with nearly 4,000 tests since january 18 yielding a three percent positivity rate that is well below the county’s rate, with both falling over the past week. as a reminder, testing is available for all sjsu students, employees, volunteers and auxiliary employees at the event center, monday - friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. sign up here for an appointment. if you need to get your booster shot, sjsu has partnered with safeway pharmacy to host a booster shot clinic on thursday, feb. 10 from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the student wellness center. . visit mhealthsystem.com/sjsucovid to make an appointment. please visit the health advisories website for updates regarding our university’s response to the pandemic. it will be so wonderful to see those who are on campus next week as we continue to adapt how we live, work, and learn in this new environment. please continue to be flexible, kind and patient with one another, you never know what someone might be coping with. sincerely, steve perez interim president email: healthadvisories@sjsu.edu sign up for alert sjsu
