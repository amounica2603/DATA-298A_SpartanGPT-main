: december 4, 2020 : president mary a. papazian dear campus community, today, december 4, six bay area counties, including santa clara county, announced the stateâ€™s new regional stay at home order [pdf] will go into effect . the county did not want to wait for intensive care unit (icu) bed availability to reach critical levels to implement the order, which will run through . the order calls for county residents to stay inside their homes and away from others in order to prevent the spread of covid-19 and only to leave for essential reasons. the state order allows educational institutions, like sjsu, to remain open for in-person learning. university housing services will remain open and residents have been provided additional information about housing options. the dining commons remains open as well. physical distancing must be maintained and masks are to be worn on campus. it is important during this return to restrictive orders that we care for our physical and mental health and continue to abide by our spartan community promise . we must continue to come together during this trying time. sincerely, dr. mary a. papazian president email: healthadvisories@sjsu.edu sign up for alert sjsu
