in this workshop, we will review some of the most common grammar and punctuation errors in student writing, including run-ons, comma splices, and general punctuation misuse. we also have a recorded version of this workshop available: clear writing is presenting information so that it is easy for everyone to read and understand. generally writing is considered clear and direct when there are identifiable subjects and verbs. this workshop will provide a step-by-step guide to untangling and revising unclear or convoluted sentences. we will focus on turning abstract nouns into concrete subjects and presenting crucial actions in verbs in order to make your writing clear and concise. we also have a recorded version of this workshop available: think about a tender, juicy cut of filet mignon, medium rare. does anything ruin that first perfect bite like a mouthful of gooey fat? this experience is similar to that of a reader forced to read a sentence that sounds like this: “ for the first and earliest time in his short young life, michael was experiencing and feeling the sensations commonly associated with love, an emotion he had never felt before.” it's a common misconception among beginning writers that using more words makes one's writing sound more intelligent. the opposite is true. the trick to good writing is to say as much as you can in as few words as possible. trim the fat, leave the meat. this workshop will explore strategies for recognizing and removing this undesirable fattiness from your writing. we also have a recorded version of this workshop available: learn how to write well-developed, well-written body paragraphs that support a thesis statement and clearly explain quotes or other arguments. you will receive an accompanying packet of handouts on essay form. we also have a recorded version of this workshop available: introductions are critical aspects of a paper because their contents and quality can compel a reader to either read or pass over an academic paper and open or close a reader's mind to the contents within it. an introduction influences the way a reader will understand a paper's contents by hinting at a paper’s purpose and content, providing context for understanding the writer’s train of thought, and establishing relationships between ideas that are forthcoming. a killer introduction will pique a reader's interest and make them eager to read your paper. this workshop will offer techniques for writing and revising introductions, including how to identify when they have reached "killer" status. we also have a recorded version of this workshop available: do you need to improve your essay organization?

and then, how do you go about integrating this material into your writing without the quotations appearing clunky, overwrought, or out of place? this workshop will help you learn how to select and integrate source material into formal writing assignments by exploring how to evaluate and introduce quotations and how to make analysis both clear and insightful. we also have a recorded version of this workshop available: in the film mrs. doubtfire, robin williams calls his ex-wife many times pretending to be the worst possible candidates to serve as a nanny. while the scene is entertaining, viewers are left wondering: what if i'm making some of those same mistakes as i apply to jobs?

(note that this workshop is intended for early career graduate students or upper-division undergraduates intending to enter graduate school.) we also have a recorded version of this workshop available: . slides and data visualizations can make or break your presentation. this workshop is meant to teach design principles and introduce online tools for non-designers. before and after examples will be used to showcase how to use color schemes and white space, to contrast elements, and to communicate main ideas effectively. during the workshop, you will practice redesigning slides and leave with a list of tools you can start using today in your own presentations. the research paper is a common type of writing in academics and in the professional world; like all genres, it has certain conventions. readers expect a research paper to have certain parts--an abstract, an introduction, a literature review, methodology, etc.--but those parts can be unclear if you haven't written many research papers already. this workshop aims to demystify the parts of a research paper so you can recognize those parts when you see them (e.g., in academic journal articles) and so you can produce those parts yourself. (please note that this workshop is intended for advanced/upper-division undergraduates or graduate-level students.) we also have a recorded version of this workshop available: almost every academic publication today starts with a short summary called an abstract. these abstracts are especially helpful for lengthy scientific research papers with many key findings. this workshop is geared toward stem students, and it will cover how to break down, evaluate, and construct a scientific abstract. we also have a recorded version of this workshop available: .  phone: 408-924-2308 email: writingcenter@sjsu.edu for the fastest response, contact us via email . in your message, please include your sjsu id. dr. martin luther king, jr. library, 2nd floor one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0172
