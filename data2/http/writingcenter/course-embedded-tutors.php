if you are a faculty member teaching a writing-intensive course, you can apply for a course-embedded tutor. course-embedded writing tutors are a form of supplemental instruction, and they are a valuable resource for your students throughout the writing process. they are more skilled and knowledgeable than their peers—they are fully trained and supported by the writing center—and they work three hours per week exclusively with your students. faculty members and course-embedded writing tutors work out a flexible schedule within the following guidelines: within these guidelines, faculty members and course-embedded writing tutors work together to decide how this time should be allocated. faculty with course-embedded tutors also participate in a paid writing across the curriculum (wac) workshop that explores both genre theory and practical tips/best practices for working with an embedded tutor. we do our best to accommodate faculty applications, but please keep in mind that (1) demand for this service is high, and (2) sometimes tutor-faculty schedules do not match (e.g., the tutor has their own class at the same time as the course for which you're requesting an embedded tutor). phone: 408-924-2308 email: writingcenter@sjsu.edu for the fastest response, contact us via email . in your message, please include your sjsu id. dr. martin luther king, jr. library, 2nd floor one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0172
