q: what is lpr and how is it related to virtual permit? a: license plate recognition (lpr) is an advanced parking technology that reads license plates as virtual permits instead of using paper permits or sticker permits. sjsu utilizes license plate recognition technology to assist in the management of campus parking. q: how does lpr work? a: all vehicles parked on sjsu property are required to purchase a permit through pay-station/mobile payment or register with parking services and pay for parking via parking online services. the vehicle’s license plate number is linked to a virtual permit. enforcement officers will scan license plates of vehicles parked in sjsu-enforced parking lots and garages. using a mobile, hand-held, or vehicle-mounted system, they will scan license plates one vehicle and one area at a time, similar to the way they currently inspect permits in windshields. when read, the numbers on your plate are automatically referenced against the parking database to verify a valid virtual permit and the proper parking location for the permit. if the license plate and vehicle information are not associated with a valid virtual permit or the vehicle is parked in the incorrect area, the vehicle will be subject to a ticket. as each vehicle’s license plate is used for identification purposes, license plates must be registered precisely to avoid being issued a citation. errors in registration are the responsibility of the registrant and will cause the issuance of a violation. q: how will my license plate information be used? a: identification of vehicles entering sjsu property will improve access control, enforcement of sjsu parking policy, electronic surveillance and enhance security and safety of sjsu. information on vehicles coming to campus will be anonymized and aggregated to analyze various metrics including parking patterns, permit-type usage and compliance. q: how can virtual permits be purchased? a: sjsu parking online services is the university’s central parking portal for the majority of your semester/academic/annual parking needs. faculty, staff and students should login through the sjsu parking online services link on our parking webpage. daily virtual permits may be purchased by using the park mobile app or at the pay stations. ensure license plate information is correct. license plates entered incorrectly may be subject to a ticket. q: what happens if i don't have access to a computer or a phone? a: pay stations are available in north, west, and south garages. pay stations are also available in the park and ride lot. your license plate information will still be required when purchasing your daily permit from the pay station. ensure license plate information is correct. license plates entered incorrectly may be subject to a ticket. q: what if i get a new vehicle or a new license plate? a: if your vehicle does not have license plates yet, please type in the last 8 digits of your vehicle’s vin number. it is imperative that your license plate and vehicle information is current and correct in order to avoid an unnecessary ticket. please visit your parking online account to update your vehicle information immediately. it is also important to delete all old or unused vehicles listed on your account. q: what if i do not have a front license plate? a: if your vehicle is registered in the state of california, the state requires that two plates be displayed, one in the front and one in the back of the vehicle (california vehicle code 5200). when parking, ensure the license plate is fully visible from the drive aisle or roadway. q: what if i own more than one vehicle? a: you may register up to three vehicles under a single sjsu parking account. only one vehicle may be on campus at a time. if you need to have more than one vehicle on campus at a time, the second vehicle must be registered and paid under a separate permit or day pass. if more than one vehicle found on campus without the purchase of additional permit, both vehicles will be cited for misuse of parking permit. log in to your parking account to change vehicle information when driving a different vehicle. q: what if i have a loaner vehicle or a rental car? a: individuals are allowed to add/remove vehicles to their parking permit at any time, as well as elect to make “temporary replacements”; this includes loaner vehicles and rental cars. it is important that you remove vehicles from your account as soon as your use of the temporary vehicle has ended. q: if i can register two vehicles to my account, does that mean i can park both/multiple vehicles at the same time using that virtual permit? a: no, you may only park one vehicle on campus at one time. if you need to have more than one vehicle on campus at a time, the second vehicle must be registered and paid under a separate permit or day pass. if more than one vehicle found on campus without the purchase of additional permit, both vehicles will be cited for misuse of parking permit. q: what if two people share the same 2 vehicles? a: the lpr system has difficulty accommodating users who have the same plate associated with more than one account. to avoid confusion, we strongly recommend that you register one car to one permit and then add the second to your account temporarily if you need to bring it to campus. to register a plate temporarily, please go online. all you will need is the make, model, and plate number. remember, a vehicle and plate should only be registered to one account at any given time. q: what if i have a symbol or disabled plates? a: enter the plate number with no symbol. for disabled license plates, “dv” or “dp” must be entered along with the rest of the plate number in the order it appears on the plate. q: what happens if i enter my license plate number incorrectly when registering? a: entering your vehicle information correctly is vital to the process. if you enter your vehicle information incorrectly (especially your license plate), you may be subject to a ticket. so, please double check your information to make sure it is correct. q. can i allow another person to use my virtual permit? a: paid parking is nontransferable and can only be used by the individual who purchased it. parking privileges will be revoked for any individuals found in violation of sjsu’s parking regulations. please notify parking services at (408) 924-6556 immediately if someone attempts to sell or transfer a form of paid parking. q: will this change any parking rules? a: all current parking rules will remain in effect. a ticket will be written for not following parking rules and/or purposefully obstructing the view of your vehicle’s license plate. q: how can i avoid receiving a ticket? a: purchase your permit before your vehicle is parked on campus. ensure the license plate is accurate. be aware of where your permit is valid and park accordingly. never park on a red curb. q: where can i find updates or more information on parking at sjsu?
