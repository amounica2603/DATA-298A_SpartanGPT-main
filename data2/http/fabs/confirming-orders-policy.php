requisitions submitted to strategic sourcing - contracts & procurement services after the order has been placed with the vendor or after the university has received the products or services are called confirming orders. there are several potential problems associated with confirming orders; such as: any employee who buys products or services without going through strategic sourcing - contracts & procurement services assumes the possibility of personal liability for payment. if you submit a requisition with an invoice attached indicating the purchase has already been completed, please note that strategic sourcing and contracts & procurement services cannot process this requisition. the package will be returned to the initiating party. phone: 408-924-1558 email: financeconnect@sjsu.edu finance and business services san josé state university 60 south market street suite 470 san josé, ca 95113
