there are three budget calendars that influence budgetary decisions making at the campus level. to learn more about each, please review the budget development process by the state, california state university chancellor and board of trustees, and sjsu. budget development typically starts when the governor’s proposed budget is issued in january to the state legislature. then, in may, the proposed budget is amended to reflect updates of economic indicators, including enrollment estimates. once the state legislature passes the budget and the governor approves, the enacted budget is published in the summer. detailed information on the california budget is available on the state budget website. a more detailed state allocation timeline can be found on the department of finance timetable web page . the governor’s proposed budget is published in early january, the csu issues preliminary campus budget allocation in a coded memo, known as the “b-letter”. final allocations are provided to campuses late summer after the state finalizes its budget. the csu budget website includes system-wide information that affect campuses, such budget allocations, coded memos, fee policies and process, and relevant legislative reports. though sjsu budgets operate on a fiscal year (july 1 – june 30) and are dependent on the state and csu budget cycles, budget development at sjsu is an ongoing, multi-year process that is aligned with the strategic planning of our campus. university goals, and the processes involved in reaching these goals, influence the distribution of campus resources. during the summer months, the president’s cabinet budget blanning process commences, primarily for the sjsu operating fund. the office of budget and financial management can provide consulting and analysis during this time. after budget commitments are finalized, the office codifies them in a memo to the requesting divisions and implements them in the financial system. self-support units are also required to submit business plans to the office of budget and financial management to ensure fiscal solvency among other indicators. the call for business plans is distributed to relevant units in the spring along with a guideline that includes variables to consider. for more information about sjsu business plans, see understanding your funds . in august each year, sjsu is required to submit its final budget plan to the csu. the chancellor's office will then prepare a consolidated csu budget. this consolidated budget is provided to the department of finance as the csu’s official budget plan for the given fiscal year. phone: 408-924-1558 email: financeconnect@sjsu.edu finance and business services san josé state university 60 south market street suite 470 san josé, ca 95113
