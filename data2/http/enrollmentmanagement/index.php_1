at san jose state university (sjsu) we are considering changes to guidelines that would affect transfer students seeking admission to select programs in our charles w. davidson college of engineering. these changes would not affect freshmen applicants. our proposed changes do not apply to any other approved impaction policies currently in place for all other undergraduate programs. in addition, this change does not affect students who have already applied or are applying for admission for fall 2023 or spring 2024. for current impaction criteria visit the undergraduate admissions impaction site . the changes proposed for impaction are focused on increasing student success outcomes for transfer students while ensuring admitted transfer students are prepared to be successful in the discipline. our proposed changes aim to better enable students to complete their undergraduate degrees in a timely manner. beginning with the fall 2024 cohort, we are proposing changes to the current supplemental coursework used to give preference to applicants in the admission consideration process. the current supplemental coursework for majors in the college of engineering can be found on our impaction page . in general, we are proposing to require certain courses to be completed prior to transfer. applicants will only be considered for admission if the equivalent required coursework is complete. the table below identifies the required coursework by major, as well as supplemental coursework. students who have completed equivalent coursework to the courses listed in the supplemental coursework column will receive preference in accordance with our current impaction process (a gpa bump will be awarded for each supplemental course that is satisfied). *satisfying this requirement with a course that is based on c/c++ programming is strongly recommended. ** an as-t in computer science will satisfy all required and supplemental courses. university stakeholders and community members will have the opportunity to comment or share thoughts through a dedicated email address, impaction@sjsu.edu , or in writing to:impaction comments, ℅ coleetta mcelroy, san jose state university, one washington square, san jose, ca 95192-0020. comments submitted to impaction@sjsu.edu email will be posted here at the conclusion of the public comment period. we will be holding a stakeholders meeting along with three public hearings in march, where we will share the proposed changes and allow for questions and comments. monday, march 6, 2023 - meet with college success collaborative tuesday, march 21, 2023, 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. zoom link  recording of march 21 hearing wednesday, march 22, 2023, 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. zoom link recording of march 22 hearing thursday, march 23, 2023, 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. zoom link recording of march 23 hearing  presentation for public hearing (pdf) [pdf] we will submit a final proposal for 2024-2025 impaction changes to the california state university chancellor’s office on april 14, 2023, inclusive of any adjustments arising from consideration of public input during the hearing process. if approved by the chancellor’s office, we will implement impaction planning criteria for fall 2024 admissions beginning in june 2023. if you have questions, please contact coleetta mcelroy, interim sr. associate vice president for enrollment management at 408-924-6086. *please note this section may be updated as additional questions or comments come in during the public hearing process. the only programs that will be affected are in the charles w. davidson college of engineering and only at the transfer admission level. the impaction review process for admission to all other undergraduate programs will continue to follow the process outlined at sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction . sjsu’s current local admission area includes santa clara county for freshmen and santa clara and santa cruz counties for transfer students. students within the local admission area receive a 0.25 gpa bump. the proposed changes to admissions policies affect transfer undergraduate admission only and will not impact graduate admissions.
