including this account from kron 4 news. an op-ed by president papazian in the san francisco chronicle lays out the ways in which sjsu can assist google with its downtown san jose development project. an op-ed by president papazian published in the sacramento bee asserts that “the liberal arts must remain a vital part of higher education for the sake of the future of our students, our economy, and our society.”  sjsu and ibm sign an agreement that promises to deliver enhanced tech skills to students, faculty and staff. “this collaboration between ibm and san jose state is perfect for us. we are the anchor institution in silicon valley providing the workforce,” said president papazian. armenia has growth in it, and i hope we will continue to build and grow this sector, president of sjsu mary papazian said as she arrived in yerevan to participate in wcit 2019. papazian said the growth in the it sector is very important, and this will bring to a healthy economy. collaboration and collegiality are also watchwords for president papazian. “everybody’s point of view at that level is important and valued,” she says. “i’m not going to have people jumping on other people, explaining to other people, taking an idea that somebody else has expressed.” president papazian only agreed to have the painting exhibited in such a public way if it was part of a larger statement about sjsu. “it’s really an honor being part of a long tradition at san jose state,” she said. “but it’s important only in so far as it’s the current representation of something that reaches back into the past.” “i think about the intersection between creativity and innovation and tech skills. in today’s world, in the fourth tech revolution, it is taking diverse perspectives, having the ability to ask a lot of questions from diverse angles and having the ability to see human impact of things.” “we have done a great deal in various parts of our community, involved in the neighborhoods and other areas. but we haven't always been at the table in the way we should be as the largest entity in the downtown.” “'we're in silicon valley, it's a public university, we're supplying the workforce—but what's the connection?' there’s a disconnect between these global companies and, not just our local community, frankly, but our national community.”
