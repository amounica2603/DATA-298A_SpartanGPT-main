the undergraduate research opportunity program (urop) is an exciting opportunity for students to engage in research and mentorship experiences with sjsu faculty in their discipline or project of interest. urop seeks to improve university retention rates and enrich student academic experiences via direct engagement in research, scholarship, and creative activity during their first and second years. through urop, students will work up to 10 hours per week with a faculty mentor on research or scholarly projects (hours and project are determined based on faculty-submitted projects). students will enroll in a year-long (6-unit) curriculum with other cohort members, receive dedicated peer mentorship, and present their research at two end-of-year symposiums (celebration of research and lurie college showcase). urop is open to all full and part-time faculty across campus. we encourage all interested faculty to submit a project and serve as a faculty mentor. faculty mentors will have the following expectations: all faculty rsca projects should be submitted by the end of august. students will begin reaching out to faculty to interview for that project through september and october. by early november it is our hope that each student will be paired with a faculty mentor and project. feel free to contact professor andrew carter - andrew.carter@sjsu.edu - for more information. office of diversity, equity, and inclusion office of the president administration building room 104 one washington square san jos√©, ca 95192-0007
