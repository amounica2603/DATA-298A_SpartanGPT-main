dear sjsu campus community, this week we have witnessed gun violence throughout our state, and many communities - both at sjsu and more broadly - may still be struggling to process it all. while we are holding our asian pacific islander community members in our hearts and minds, and as details emerge from half moon bay, we also know that our latinx community is hurting deeply as well. we wish to provide a space for those who seek to be in community (both in person and virtually) and connect with others, process, honor those lost, and share a healing space. while currently away from campus meeting with csu trustees, president teniente matson wanted to convey her commitment to supporting all who need it during these trying days, as we seek together to make sense of the senseless. in partnership with the solidarity network , asian pacific islander faculty staff association (apifsa) , and the office of diversity, equity, and inclusion , please join us on thursday, january 26, 2023, from 11:30am-1:30pm for an in-person and virtual healing space for our impacted communities and allies to come together. this will be an opportunity to meet and provide support for each other; attendees are encouraged to come and go as they may need. healing space (in-person) office of diversity, equity, and inclusion building: administration  room: 104 register for the virtual option in solidarity, patience d. bryant, ph.d. interim deputy diversity officer director of black/african american equity office of diversity, equity, and inclusion office of the president administration building room 104 one washington square san jos√©, ca 95192-0007
