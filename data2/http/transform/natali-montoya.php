moving away from college to sjsu was easily the best decision of my life. as a first-generation college graduate, i was the first person in my family to go to college and move away from home. this experience was eye-opening and one of a kind; it made me into who i am today. i moved to downtown san jos√© from a small city in the central valley. i had never lived on my own or been around such a diverse group of people. i always appreciated how diverse the sjsu campus is because it made me feel so comfortable, more comfortable than the high school i went to. the environment sjsu brings was the perfect fit for me and it brought nothing but joy. i had the best experience at sjsu. i went in not knowing what i was getting myself into, but living on my own helped me be independent and grow. being away from home was hard at times, but this entire experience transformed me into an independent hardworking young lady. it also made me appreciate home, family, and the little things. i met/had such inspiring professors that gave me so much useful knowledge about life and my future career. my public health professors have made me so passionate about the public health field. there are so many great clubs and organizations offered every semester. i joined a sorority and intramural sports my freshman year and i made life-long friendships through those activities. i recommend sjsu to almost every person i know, and i talk so highly of it and always will. i had the best experience there and a great education. but life is what you make it!
