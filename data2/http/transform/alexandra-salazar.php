i began my journey in science in 2015. at the time, i was coming from a low income community and underserved high school where i didn't even know what a phd was or what conducting research meant. coming to sjsu introduced me to the mentors that would see my potential and help transform me into the scientist i am becoming. thanks to the resources and guidance i received at sjsu, i will begin pursuing my phd in neuroscience at the scripps research institute starting fall 2021.
