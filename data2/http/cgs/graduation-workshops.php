each semester, graduate admissions and program evaluations (gape) hosts several online graduation workshops via zoom. please join us for these online information sessions where a gape evaluator will explain important university processes such as candidacy, course substitutions, and applying for graduation. students will also be able to ask questions via a q&a session to clear up any confusion they may be experiencing.
