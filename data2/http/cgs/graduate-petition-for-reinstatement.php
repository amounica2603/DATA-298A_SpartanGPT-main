reinstatement following disqualification may be accomplished in four ways via the graduate petition for reinstatement: note that this form must be initiated by the graduate coordinator, however, the student should work closely with the graduate coordinator to provide correct information and to clearly understand the process of both reinstatement and readmission. international students must contact isss as the procedure for reinstatement differs and must work with an isss advisor to ensure visa compliance. complete a reinstatement petition (graduate coordinator only)
