 she/her/hers graduate studies coordinator dominique.walker@sjsu.edu (408) 924-2401 b.a. psychology, san jose state university, 2020 linkedin   dominique is a recent graduate of san jose state university, where she obtained her bachelor of arts in psychology. during her time as an undergrad, she served with several on-campus departments, including spartan shops, the humanities department, conference services, and university housing services. she attributes her time working on-campus and her experience with alpha phi omega, a national service fraternity, as the source that sparked her passion for working within higher education to support students and university operations. currently, dominique serves as the graduate studies coordinator for the college of graduate studies where she provides administrative support to the college and the students they serve. in this position, she is responsible for the dean’s office coordination, cgs website maintenance, and providing event support by assisting with the planning, researching, and coordination of all cgs events. in the future, dominique plans to continue her education by pursuing a master’s degree in counseling and guidance to better support students' mental health and academic success. some things i enjoy are listening to music, playing video games, baking, watching movies/tv shows, dancing, doing community service, and spending time with friends. the coolest thing about working here is that since i attended sjsu during my undergrad, i am very familiar with the campus and how it operates. this allows me to better assist students with their questions and issues even if it doesn’t directly relate to my department. being able to help and support student needs is my favorite part of my position. my advice for any student is to make friends and connections with the students and professors in your program. your classmates are going through some of the same experiences and challenges as you are, so it can be helpful to have someone that understands what your going through. plus you never know what tips and tricks they can offer you. your professors can also be a valuable connection as they can make recommendations about fellowships, jobs, and other career-boosting opportunities throughout and beyond school. it's always a good idea to make these connections early and update them on your progress even after you’ve graduated. “never be limited by other people’s limited imaginations.” —dr. mae jemison
