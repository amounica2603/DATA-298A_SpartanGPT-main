need their support in making a class announcement. also, in a scenario where a course has strict policies against using a laptop in class and the student has an accommodation for typed notes or a policy against students “copying” lecture material, the instructor will know who is allowed to use their laptops and allow the notetaker to take notes. if students have a classmate they would like to be the notetaker, students should email aec-notetaking@sjsu.edu with the potential notetakers full name and email. the aec will then contact them with further instructions. yes, instructors can log

comes with the mac os and ios) and requires no additional effort by the user. the windows version of lockdown browser allows a student to use some screen reader programs, such as jaws. it's important
