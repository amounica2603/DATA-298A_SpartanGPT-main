clear gifs in html-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. california business & professions code section 22575(b) (as amended effective january 1, 2014) provides that california residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to "do not track" (dnt) browser settings. dnt is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. we do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users' online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses our sites and therefore do not respond to dnt signals.  we share your information internally at the csu to facilitate and manage the purposes listed above, including with third parties whom the university engages to process your personal information on our behalf for
