my work is anchored in examining the sociology of higher education. my research centers on four core strands: (1) historicizing and contextualizing race-conscious affirmative action policies; (2) applying a critical analysis to framing and discourse as related to race-conscious policies, (3) promoting equity oriented critical policy analysis for praxis, and (4) interrogating “first-generation-ness” as a continuum, which includes examining the experiences of first-generation faculty. dr. maría ledesma was featured on a panel hosted by the ucla division of social sciences to discuss the context and implications of california proposition 16. dr. maría ledesma was featured on a panel at stanford's race, inequality, and language in education (rile) conference during the fall 2020 semester. watch the full recording above - dr. ledesma begins speaking at 36:42 . listen to maría's playlist below and access all of the personality playlists on our lurie college of education spotify account sjsu connie l. lurie college of education sweeney hall 103 one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0071 create opportunities for lurie college students!
