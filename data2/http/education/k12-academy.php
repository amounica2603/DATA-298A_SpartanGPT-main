| assistant professor science/teacher education | sjsu lurie college of education | twitter: @tavisint the intersecting covid-19 and racial injustice crises have re-exposed the interwoven social, racial, political, and economic dimensions of educational opportunity and the injustices laid bare are many. this workshop will empower educators across disciplines from kindergarten to college as designers and leaders, who have the opportunity to transform inequitably designed education systems by radically reimagining and building learning environments from a foundation of human dignity and respect. this workshop focuses on the design of equitable, inclusive, and justice-centered learning environments through the creation of design principles. design principles serve as tenets for pedagogy and practice and as guidelines for the design of future learning experiences. to support this, i will draw from my experience as a science teacher educator and learning scientist exploring race, identity, and learning in science education; a professional pathway built from black brilliance, generous mentorship, and the wisdom of scholars of color. as such, the workshop will engage in reimagining efforts that center the transformative and sustaining practices of black, indigenous, latinx and other scholars of color who inspire the education community to approach teaching and learning from new ethical and pedagogical imaginations. workshop attendees will be introduced to design principles and guided through the construction process through an example from my secondary science methods course where teacher candidate’s construct design principles for teaching (science) for equity and inclusion. while science is the focal example, educators from any discipline are encouraged and welcome as this practice is widely applicable. educators will leave the workshop with an expanded understanding of how to design learning environments that affirm and sustain the identities of minoritized students in/outside of science. this workshop offers hope and possibility for learning communities during the present crises and a reimagining of what they can become moving forward. -
