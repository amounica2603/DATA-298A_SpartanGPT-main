in recent months, we've witnessed a significant amount of advocacy around social justice issues such as addressing racial injustice and systemic racism, greater access to healthcare, home and food insecurity, wealth inequality and unemployment, climate change, and more. with that in mind, lurie college has organized a student social justice short film festival to amplify the voices of middle school, high school, community college, and university students around what social justice issues are significant to them. we are planning to build upon the success of our inaugural fall 2020 student social justice film festival by organizing another film festival during the fall 2021 semester! our organizing committee is going to host webinars for educators and students during summer 2021 to learn more about how to participate in the film festival. if you have any initial questions about participating in this film festival, please email us at luriecollege@sjsu.edu . we spoke with our winning filmmakers - natalie, jose, and vinson - to learn more about what motivated them to create their films and what their future plans for advocating for social justice are. watch the interview with them above and watch their individual films below. connect with natalie on instagram and facebook . connect with jose on youtube . connect with vinson on instagram , twitter , or linkedin if you have any follow up questions about participating in this film festival, contact us at luriecollege@sjsu.edu or on instagram , facebook , or twitter . the student social justice short film festival was established by the student, alumni, and faculty member below from our lurie college ed.d. leadership program, where our doctoral students have been able to complete a documentary dissertation in place of a more traditional essay dissertation. watch some samples of recent documentary dissertations at sjsu.edu/edd/academics/dissertation . sjsu connie l. lurie college of education sweeney hall 103 one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0071 create opportunities for lurie college students!
