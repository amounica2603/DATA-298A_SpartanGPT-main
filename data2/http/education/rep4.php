the newly-established rapid education prototyping (rep4) alliance is a powerful network of regional and national education, industry, and technology leaders, led by the six founding higher education partners, including the sjsu lurie college of education. this alliance will create opportunities to bring together diverse learners to codesign new ideas for education using liberatory design principles. in summer 2021, we launched this network with a free learner design summit, which is a leadership development opportunity designed to bring together rising 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students, recent high school graduates, community college students, and sjsu undergraduate students to collaborate and design creative proposals to address existing challenges in the higher education system. watch the video above to learn more about the proposals from our student design leaders, who met one another for the first time, came up with and refined their proposals, and presented them to the sjsu president and senior administration within 4 days. “i really, really enjoyed this experience of meeting and connecting with great people. everybody shared what problems they had faced, and that really opened up my mind to see what we can do and what we need to change.” -

faculty mentor the concept of this prototype is to provide opportunities for prospective and future students to experience college life. with limited exposure to the college experience, it can be challenging for students to be able to decide if college is for them and which colleges and majors to apply to. we hope to fulfill this need through our prototype to implement a shadowing experience, where students from middle school, high school, and community college can shadow an sjsu mentor for the day. future students will have an opportunity to learn about the opportunities that sjsu has to offer to them through a personalized shadowing experience. students will be matched with an experienced college mentor based on their personal interests. -
