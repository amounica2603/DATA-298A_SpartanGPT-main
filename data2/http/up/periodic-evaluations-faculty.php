the primary purpose of the periodic evaluation or “mini review” is to provide probationary faculty with an annual assessment of the progress they have made toward earning tenure and promotion. these reviews are formative, providing the probationary faculty with review of the 3 categories of achievement in university policy s15-8, so as to encourage professional growth that will merit the award of tenure, and advancement in rank if applicable, by the end of the probationary period. post tenure review is specified in the collective bargaining agreement (cba) article 15.35: sjsu’s policy on post tenure review is s97-5 [pdf] . it asserts that the purpose of the post tenure review is to evaluate the professional effectiveness of the faculty member in terms of the scope and currency of their professional work, with reference to their current and future professional career plans. the review, to the extent possible, should focus on a positive, formative, and proactive approach to enhancing faculty careers. up-faculty services will be hosting training sessions for faculty due for either mini review or post tenure review. during the sessions, the training videos will be shown, and up-fs staff will be present to answer questions that you may have regarding the usage of efaculty. the training sessions will be hosted via zoom, and no registration is required. university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
