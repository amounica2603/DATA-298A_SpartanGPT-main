if you have a question that is not answered below, please email chrs@sjsu.edu . no. the new system will have a different url so even if your favorites did come over they would not work. in addition, the new system will be a new version of peoplesoft so the names and locations of pages will likely be different. yes and no. your sjsu id remains the same in the mysjsu system and is your sjsu campus id for all intents and purposes. however, a new id will be assigned in the chrs system, which will be displayed on various pages in the system, including csu id search, job data, etc. most employees will not need to know their chrs id. yes. the process to add and edit favorites is slightly different in chrs, but you will definitely be able to add your favorite pages. while some basic functionality will be similar to the current sjsu @ work environment, many pages and processes will be different. please see chrs changes for more information on anticipated changes. no. chrs is a different version of peoplesoft so the overall look and feel will be slightly different. self service functions will look vastly different. navigation will be similar but most of it will be different from what you do now. yes. this will be part of the overall training plan that the chrs project team rolls out. no. the employee profile will not be converted into chrs. development is underway of new functionality to facilitiate the online requests and routing of transactions. no. the mysjsu system will not change. you will continue to manage class rosters and grading through that system. yes and no. chrs is the overall system and includes both the consolidated peoplesoft system (chrs) and the chrs recruiting system (pageup). when we say chrs, we are referring to the peoplesoft system. we will always say chrs recruiting when referring to pageup. likely not. as technology improves and systems are modified to make processes and functions more user-friendly, updates and upgrades need to occur. it is also critical to upgrade systems in order to get the best support from our vendors. all csu campuses are required by the chancellor's office to make this change. moving to a consolidated environment will ensure consistency in process and reporting between campuses and will also allow the chancellor's office to pull data directly from the system instead of asking every campus to submit the information. once all campuses are in the consolidated environment, we anticipate financial savings due to the reduced number of databases the system pays for, and reduced expense when doing upgrades to the system. moving to a consolidated environment will ensure consistency in process and reporting between campuses and will also allow the chancellor's office to pull data directly from

either chrs@sjsu.edu or hr-info-systems@sjsu.edu for assistance with the various processes. we also plan to hold regular open labs where you can drop in for help from the experts. it's hard to say for sure but we know that the processes in academic departments will be vastly different, so the majority of the peoplesoft hr work will change. for those in non-academic departments, the work will not change as much since most of what is done is looking at data or running reports. staff in central offices like university personnel will experience a higher level of change but much of the work will be the same. please see chrs changes for more detailed information on anticipated changes in the new system. the two projects are not connected. the new verison of peoplesoft (hcm 9.2) does have an improved user interface. we believe it will be easier to navigate, especially for self-service functions. for many employees, the primary impact will be the change to self-service functions like entering/approving time and absences, updating benefits information, updating personal data, etc. for those who use the system for more than self-service, the impacts will be greater depending on your role. please see chrs changes for more detailed information on anticipated changes in the new system. student employees will continue entering their time in the new system in a similar manner. the look and feel is different but the process is almost identical to what you do now. this does not change anything you do in mysjsu. please review changes by employee type on the chrs changes page for more detailed information on anticipated changes for student employees. faculty will primarily use the system for self-service functions like updating personal or beneifts data and entering/approving time and absences. department chairs & directors may also do approvals of temporary faculty transactions in the system via the self-service pages. what you do in mysjsu will not change. please review changes by employee type on the chrs changes page for more detailed information on anticipated changes for faculty. a few. only employees will be retrieved in searches, as opposed to now when students are also listed in search results. clicking on the details link the page retrieved will be a summary of information only. this is a change from what is displayed now. the chrs id will be displayed in the results, not the campus id, and the ssn and dob may be masked depending on your access. yes, especially for self-service functions. in order for all campuses to be in the same system the numbering had to be redone. it was not possible in the design to append current ids with a campus code to distinguish between duplicate id numbers. no. you will continue to log into sjsu systems, including chrs, with your sjsuone and duo credentials. the only employees in tower foundation that will be impacted are those who maintain poi data and anyone who needs to approve time for work study students. this will most likely be a handful of employees in the hr unit of tower. no. all benefits self service processes will be different. many of the current processes were customized by sjsu and won't be in the new system. we will have more details on this as we dig into the new functionality. no. all benefits self service processes will be different. many of the current processes were customized by sjsu and won't be in the new system. we will have more details on this as we dig into the new functionality. maybe. we will review the forthcoming onbase functionality in comparison to what chrs offers and determine what the best process is for our campus. yes. the new temporary academic employment module is workflow-driven and should streamline the processes as well as reducing the amount of data that needs to be keyed manually by various departments. yes. the new temporary academic employment module is workflow-driven and should streamline the processes as well as reducing the amount of data that needs to be keyed manually by various departments. the redesigned functionality should make it easier for department admins to enter/update numerous employees at the same time. maybe. we have not yet reviewed the functionality enough to provide a definitive answer. however, we expect that you will appoint ferps through one of the new workflow-based transaction processes. more to come... we don't have an answer for this yet but are aware of the need for employee data to get to cfs. we expect there will be a way but it is yet to be determined. yes. however, if you update your address in mysjsu, it will not update the chrs system. no. however, if you update your address in chrs, it will update mysjsu. as far as we know, yes. the functionality looks much different but we expect to be able to decentralize the process as we have it now. no. the poi types will be similar but there will be some changes. impacted departments will be notified of any changes to the type(s) of pois they can use. an hr data warehouse will be delivered as part of chrs and we anticipate being able to provide a way to view this information through that system. no. however, we hope to deliver something similar through the hr data warehouse that will be delivered with chrs. no. as position numbers could easily be duplicated from campus to campus, all positions will be renumbered at the time of conversion. we hope to be able to deliver an active position list type report on day 1 so that departments can see their new position lists. no. inactive positions that have never had an incumbent will not be converted. if they ever had an incumbent, they will be converted in an inactive status. active positions that have never had an incumbent will be reviewed, and those that have never had an incumbent (other than those currently in recruitment) will not be converted. we are still investigating the best way to go about this but believe there is a way for us to get that data after the conversion and post it. we are not clear if there will be a way to query the data in the system. we hope to have a more definitive answer soon. yes and no. chrs recruiting (pageup) is a separate system, and no changes are expected other than those delivered by pageup on a regular basis. however, certain aspects of the integration on the peoplesoft side (chrs) will look a bit different. this will only impact those who manage the integration for recruitments. no. the tracker i-9 tool is not connected to chrs so the process for i-9s will not change once chrs is live. however, once all campuses are live in chrs (2024), this process may be modified. no. unfortunately that's not possible due to changes in the structure of tables and the additional security needed in the shared environment. the sjsu chrs team will provide a plan for how to save your criteria so you can rebuild the queries in the new environment. possibly. query security will be more restrictive in chrs since there will be a data warehouse for reporting. however, we will review the campus needs and determine who can have this access. thre are many people in central offices (e.g. up, finance, etc.) who will need to be able to create queries directly in chrs. more to come on this. no. we will not be converting the current lcd reports into the new system. however, an hr data warehouse will be delivered as part of chrs and we anticipate being able to provide similar reports through that system. no. since a public query would be available for all campuses, the chancellor's office will have a process in place where a campus can request a public query. it will be reviewed by all campuses to determine if it's needed. most of the public queries you see in the current system will be moved to the new reporting solution instead of query. the system contains a number of queries that may be useful for managers or other employees, depending on what your needs are. we plan to develop and deliver additional reports through the new reporting solution. if you have a specific type of query/report you're hoping to see, please email chrs@sjsu.edu and let us know. we'll do our best to accommodate your request. yes. your sjsuone credentials will be used to log into the system. you will not need to complete a system access request form for the implementation. this will be part of the conversion steps the sjsu project team will handle. after the go-live, should you require additional access, a request would need to be submitted. yes and no. the csu will deliver systemwide security permissions and the sjsu project team will do our best to map current access to the new roles. there are certain functions that will no longer be done at the campus level, such as requesting and running time administration, but the majority of your access should be the same. yes. department security will not change in chrs. your current access will be converted. in most cases, yes. we are doing our best to build security ahead of time so that no one has any downtime when the new system goes live. however, there is new functionality that will require training and we may not grant that ahead of time. this is still being discussed and more information will be communicated as we progress through the project. yes. this can still be done for those appointments that don't come through chrs recruiting (e.g. tas, gas, isas, etc.). there is no delivered up process for temporary academic employment involving docusign. however, if a department or college has an internal process that will need to be reviewed to determine if the new functionality can replace it or not. there will be several clicks from login to approval. there is no way to avoid this unfortunately. we don't have an answer for this yet but hope to in the near future. not that we are aware of. however, we will ask this question to confirm. no. there is no delivered functionality for that since chrs is meant to be a request system for absences not a reporting system. yes. if the absence has not been approved, the employee can delete it. if the absence has been approved but is not yet processed, the approver can delete it. if the absence has been processed, a payroll represenataive will have to delete it. yes. there will be extensive training on the new system in the late spring/early summer of 2022. there will be instructor-led training for all non-self-service functionality. this will likely take place via zoom, but we will make a final decision on that in the spring of 2022. there will be videos and documentation for all self-service functionality. new documentation will be created for all processes. maybe. not everyone in an auxiliary will use sjsu @ work but those who need to maintain poi data or approve student time will definitely benefit from training. university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south
