there are limited circumstances where gifts that afford a personal benefit to a csu employee can be considered a gift to the csu, and therefore need not be reported on the employee’s electronic form 700: statement of economic interests. mostly, these are travel gifts, including accommodations and food associated with the travel. to qualify as a gift to the csu, the following strict statutory requirements must be met: failure to comply with any of these requirements will result in the gift being classified as personal to the individual who traveled, and reportable on his/her electronic form 700: statement of economic interests. travel payments are limited to the amount of csu’s own reimbursement rates. if the cost of travel exceeds this rate, the difference is considered a gift to the employee and, if over $50 is reportable on the employee’s electronic form 700: statement of economic interests. university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
