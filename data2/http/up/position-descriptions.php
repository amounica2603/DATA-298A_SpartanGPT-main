positions descriptions (pds) play a critical role in a variety of processes in university personnel. without a pd we canâ€™t classify a position or recruit for a vacancy. a pd describes the essential functions of a position, how much time is spent doing those functions, and the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to do the work. the pd is used to build a job posting when a position is vacant and may be used to determine whether or not a work accommodation can be made, should such a need arise. the classification & compensation team can help you develop a pd and will work with you to ensure the work is described accurately. university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
