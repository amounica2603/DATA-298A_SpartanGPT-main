faculty additional employment refers to any compensated appointment in addition to the faculty member's primary work appointment, creating a work “overload” or assigning work at times when work is not normally required. some examples of additional employment appointments are: requests for appointments are made via procedures outlined in the additional employment guide and web pages. these guidelines follow csu additional employment policy, (see csu coded memorandum hr 2002-05 [pdf] and csu coded memorandum hr/salary 2015-22 [pdf] ), and the faculty (unit 3) collective bargaining agreement (cba). if there are discrepancies between this document and those just listed, the hr memoranda and the cba prevail. these guidelines apply to all faculty at sjsu or any of its authorized auxiliary organizations, and to any additional appointments compensated by the university, regardless of the source of funding. affected employment includes appointments at any regular csu program or auxiliary organization as well as appointments on more than one campus in the csu. these guidelines also apply throughout the year whether during the regular semester or during summer or intersession, and during faculty duty days and non-duty days. additional employment in excess of full time, and most appointments for extra work do not affect university retirement credits or benefits payments—no benefits accrue—and it is not reported to calpers ( hr-tl-sa2021-08 [pdf] ). additional employment appointments are made using a different class code than the one faculty already occupy. departments must have a position number associated with each class code. (to request new position numbers, visit the position management web page .) they must have an understanding of faculty base rates and dynamics of appointment timebases. for questions concerning additional employment, please contact additionalemployment-faculty@sjsu.edu . in all cases, faculty additional employment appointments are not assigned until approved by university personnel - faculty services (up - fs). approval must be attained prior to any work being performed. requests may be denied. faculty and/or departments may not approve their own start dates independent of official up - fs approval. the appointment's base rate is usually the same as for other appointments, but it may be reduced or increased when duties warrant it. the primary rule about faculty additional employment is that it shall not interfere with the primary faculty (or staff) assignment. additional employment must be approved, and it may be denied if there are concerns about interference with regular duties. the csu-cfa cba article 36 [pdf] , provision 36.5 states: a faculty unit employee shall be limited in csu employment to the equivalent of one full-time position in [their] primary or normal employment. an "overage" of up to twenty five percent (25%) of a full-time position shall be allowed if the overage employment:  one can never exceed 125% timebase, but how timebase is calculated varies over time and by appointment type. however, when circumstances restrict choices and actually warrant "overload" additional employment, category 2403 appointments ( tl-sa2015-22 [pdf] ) will be the preferred option for full-time faculty. in all faculty cases, the preferred strategy is to avoid an overload appointment during the regular semester. there are at least 3 tactics to do so:  load balance records are kept internally in the department and/or college. see university policy f70-5 [pdf] and accompanying memo [pdf] for more information and consult your college dean. critical to understanding what is allowed for additional employment is knowing what constitutes an appointment timebase. this section will review "timebase" and discuss the relationship between work hours, weighted teaching units (wtu), and full time equivalent faculty (ftef). in the csu system, a regular work week is 40 hours. when allowed, an overage may not exceed 10 hours per week or 25% of the regular timebase. a faculty member at 125% employment is working for, at most, 50 hours per week. therefore, during the academic year, overage additional employment may not exceed 10 hours per week (inclusive of all csu employment). teaching and other faculty duties are also measured in wtus ( article 20 [pdf] , 20.2,d). the wtu is linked to the accreditation standard of 17 weeks of instruction, and where a 15 wtu workload equals 40 hours per week. quantitative thinkers will see immediately that 1 (one) wtu is equal to 45.33 hours. it follows that 3 wtus is 136 hours of employment; 15 wtus is 680 hours of employment (680/17=40). classes are quite often assigned in increments of 3 wtus, and faculty workload is often expressed with phrases like, "12 wtus of instruction and 3 wtus of service and advising." the wtu metric may be imposed on any spanse of time for which additional employment is requested. applying algebra, one sees that the workload stated in a number of hours per week must increase if the time span is less than 17 weeks. on the other hand, workload as the number of hours per week must decrease if the time span is greater than 17 weeks. another important term is "full time equivalent faculty," (ftef). ftef is the proportion (sometimes called percent) of a full time position. during a 40 hour week, .25 ftef equals 10 hours (10/40). fifteen (15) wtus is 1.0 ftef during fall and spring semesters. during those times, a 3 wtu appointment is .2 ftef (3/15). when time spanses change, available hours change (e.g., winter and summer session), and 3 wtus no longer represent 20% (.2 ftef) employment. to further illustrate the effects of the length of an academic term on faculty appointments, consider what happens during winter session. this typically 3 week term encompasses 120 hours of regular workload (40 hours per week). however, the classes taught are typically 3 wtus (136 hours). this dynamic forces an overload appointment during the intersession (non duty days) of 1.13 ftef (136/120=1.13 ftef or 113%). to review, during winter, 3 wtus workload equates to 45.33 hours per week and an appointment of 1.13 ftef. additional employment must be compensated at the faculty member's normal rate unless the work warrants a deviation from that rate. the compensation is also delimited by the salary schedule for the employment type or other agreements with funding sources. for example, the salary schedule for classification category 2322, instructional faculty, special programs — for credit [pdf] , used during winter session, often compensates faculty at a lower rate.      university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
