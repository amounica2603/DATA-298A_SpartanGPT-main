performance evaluations are important for all employees. the goal is to increase communication, establish clear expectations, reinforce good performance, improve unsatisfactory performance, and foster a spirit of cooperation and teamwork. receiving feedback throughout the year is equally important and should come in the form of one-on-ones with your manager, group meetings, etc. nothing in your probationary or annual evaluations should ever come as a surprise. it should be a summary of what occurred during the evaluation period. timelines forms and resources timelines forms and resources  questions? email performanceevaluation@sjsu.edu . university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
