do you have questions about staff evaluations? please see the frequently asked questions below. an employee can only be evaluated for a maximum period of 12 months. our recommendation is to do a short evaluation for the months that will fall between the two time periods in order to get on track. the evaluation will likely be very similar to the one recently completed but it’s a good chance to review goals and make sure they’re still relevant. employees on a temporary appointment for 6 months or longer should receive a review at 6 months and then annually thereafter. the same form should be used. an employee can only be evaluated for a maximum period of 12 months. do one review for the last cycle only (april 1, yyyy(last year)-march 31, yyyy(this year)). wait until the employee returns and then complete the evaluation for the time she was here between april 1, 2013 and march 31, 2014. please contact our office at performanceevaluation@sjsu.edu to provide us with the name of the individual so we can make a note regarding the situation. the majority of the collective bargaining agreements state that an employee's probationary period is extended for the same number of days an employee is on paid sick leave or family medical leave of over thirty (30) days, parental leave, and for any day an employee is on workers' compensation (wc), industrial disability leave (idl), non-industrial disability insurance (ndi), military leave or formal leave without pay (lwop). as each contract does vary slightly in language, please contact our office or consult the specific agreement to determine exactly how your employee is affected. no. the review cycle for mpps is july 1 – june 30. the stated due date is 60 days after the end of the evaluation cycle (45 days for confidential employees) but due to the transition we are granting an additional 30 days to return the evaluations to our office. yes. this is now the review cycle for all staff employees, including those in confidential classifications. our office has developed a new evaluation form that is being piloted with our confidential employees this year. we also rolled out a new form for our mpp employees last year. at this time all other employees should be evaluated on the old forms. they are posted on our website . you should assess the employee’s performance during their full probationary time period. the probationary performance evaluation should then be completed within two weeks after their full probationary time period. for example: if a 6-month evaluation needs to be completed for an employee and their 6-month ends on november 30, then the meeting should take place with the employee after november 30, but no later than december 11. university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
