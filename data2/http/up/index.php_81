an internship is a form of experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. internships give students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths; and give employers the opportunity to guide and evaluate talent. interns may be paid, unpaid, or a combination of the two and are typically appointed for no more than one year. they may not perform bargaining unit work. a non-student may not be an intern. for questions, please visit the frequently asked questions about interns page . for further assistance, please email up-volunteer-appointments@sjsu.edu for unpaid interns and classcomp@sjsu.edu for paid interns. university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
