employees are eligible for a variety of leave programs based on their bargaining unit and a variety of other factors. these leaves include, but are not limited to, family medical leave, parental leave, military leave, bereavement/funeral leave, personal and professional leave, etc. eligible faculty members have four additional leaves available (some paid, some unpaid): sabbatical, difference in pay, medical/parental leave, and personal/professional leave. the appropriate administrator is responsible for approving the use of accrued leave such as vacation, personal holiday, compensatory time off (cto), etc. employees should request the use of this time in advance, according to their collective bargaining agreement (cba) and any internal processes you have put in place. leaves without accrual balances - such as jury duty - must be approved after the fact. sick leave is also accrued and may be approved in advance when used for a medical appointment, but is typically used for an unexpected absence due to the illness of the employee or their family member. the position management structure in sjsu @ work determines who the primary approver is for absences. this is typically the employeeâ€™s direct supervisor and may be a work lead. review position & job reporting structure in sjsu @ work approve absences monthly in sjsu @ work review employee leave balances in sjsu @ work enter absences on behalf of your employees university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
