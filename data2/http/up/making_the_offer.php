once you have identified a final candidate, your recruiter will perform a salary analysis and provide you with a range within which you can pay someone. the analysis looks at the salary of the prior incumbent, similar positions in the department and division, as well as others across campus (and the csu when appropriate), and the experience of the applicant. in many cases we will also review industry salaries in the area to provide a more thorough analysis of the compensation. we make every effort to ensure equity across campus and will discuss concerns if an inequity may be created. salaries for management employees must be approved by the senior avp of university personnel before offered to the applicant. university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
