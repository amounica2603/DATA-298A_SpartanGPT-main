see calendars to view the master and student payroll calendars. : bonuses and stipends are issued separately from your base paycheck. special consultants, as well as special/winter session and substitute faculty, are paid when proper documentation including invoices are submitted, approved and processed. paychecks are distributed to each department. check with your supervisor to find your department's contact. unless expressly authorized by university personnel to do so. note: direct deposit advices (stubs) are white; live checks are green. if you enrolled in direct deposit, there is a processing time of approximately 1 to 2 pay periods before direct deposit takes effect. your first and maybe second paycheck will be a live paycheck that you must deposit at your bank. once direct deposit has finished processing, you will see your money go directly into your bank account. university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
