(requests for use of vacation days approved by the faculty member's time approver should accompany the appointment request.) faculty on sabbatical are still considered to be in a full-time 1.0 time base appointment while on sabbatical leave. per article 27.18 of the cba, faculty on sabbatical leave may not accept additional and/or outside employment without prior approval of the president. faculty appointments may not exceed full-time 1.0 ftef time base at any one campus (with exception of 36.5(d) above, in limits on additional employment appointments), but additional time base up to 25% is permitted if it is the result of the accrual of part-time employment on more than one campus. appointments up to 25% additional timebase are possible at sjsu only when certain conditions are met (see article 36 [pdf] ). summer and intersession timebase is calculated separately for ay faculty. 12-month and 10-month faculty remain on duty at their appointment fractional timebase for the duration of their appointment, reducing options for additional appointments. temporary faculty may be employed up to 18.75 wtus as a lecturer . otherwise, they are restricted to a total of 15 units or wtus of appointments, even if the appointments are in two or more different departments on the same campus. exceptions may be made to allow departments to meet timebase entitlements with occasional appointments that slightly exceed the 1.0 limit. ferp employment is limited to 90 days or 50% of the employee's regular time base in the year preceding retirement. as a result, ferp faculty are not eligible for other csu appointments while in ferp, subject to articles 29 [pdf] provisions 29.10 and 29.14. as outlined in provisions 29.8 and 29.9 of the cba, total csu calpers participating employer employment for ferp participants is limited to either (a semester is normally 85 days) . ferp participants who teach full-time one semester each academic year fall under the 90 day rule. ferp participants who teach half-time both semesters of the academic year fall under the 50% rule. each to accept any additional employment since they are already half-time (50%) in their ferp position. ferp faculty employed at a time base lower than the limits stated here should seek advice from calpers before accepting offers of additional employment. (also visit the ferp faq for more information.) participants in the are considered to be full-time for purposes of applying additional employment restrictions (see article 30 [pdf] , provision 30.10 of the collective bargaining agreement). therefore, prtb faculty may work an additional 25% only if the work meets one or more of the criteria described in a, b, or c of limits on additional employment appointments above. any retiree except ferp faculty must have a minimum separation of service of 180 calendar days prior to returning to any calpers-covered employment (including faculty positions in the csu and positions at other calpers employers) without reinstatement. they also cannot work in excess of 960 hours or 50% of the hours worked , whichever is less. retired annuitants employed at a time base lower than the limits stated here should seek advice from calpers before accepting offers of additional employment. department chairs/school directors will be limited in their ability to accept additional employment. these appointments are typically for 12-months, indicating employment over the calendar year. the time base of their appointment will be applied each day the university is open. for example, a chair with a .6 fte 12-month chair appointment will be considered in work status for 24 hours per week at any time of the year. all csu employees are subject to the 125% limit on additional employment. mpp faculty may only volunteer to teach; they may not be compensated for unit 3 employment. staff may be employed as faculty, but their combined employment may not exceed 125% timebase. in fact, staff employed in non-exempt positions must be paid overtime at the staff rate plus the faculty rate if teaching puts the appointment over 1.0 fte. managers may reduce their primary appointment time base to avoid overtime. see csu coded memorandum hr 2002-05 [pdf] for more information. also, consult university personnel for further information about restrictions. university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
