there may come a time when the needs of the department require a part-time employee to increase their time-base. this would be considered a management initiated time-base change. an employee must be given a 21-day notice for a time-base change. to initiate this change, please submit an employee profile with the requested time-base to classcomp@sjsu.edu . classification & compensation will review the request and, if approved, will provide the notification to the manager to give to the employee. an employee may submit a written request to their appropriate administrator for a change in work hours and/or workdays. such requests shall be submitted twenty-one (21) days prior to the requested effective date of the change. if the time-base change is approved by the appropriate administrator, submitting the request is the same as the management initiated process. university-personnel@sjsu.edu up north: 408-924-2450 up south: 408-924-2250  up webmaster up north administration building 242 up south upd building 3rd floor
