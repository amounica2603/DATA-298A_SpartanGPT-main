sjsu and the college of science (cos) have identified supporting and stimulating research, especially involving students, as a strategic priority. accordingly, we have implemented a number of programs to facilitate and encourage research activity. these programs have been funded through a combination of sources, including funds from the provost's office, the division of research and innovation, the college of science, and f&a reinvestment. the sjsu division of research and innovation has a request for applications (rfa) for the rapid response initiative. the purpose of this rfa is to provide a mechanism of internal support for research, scholarship and creative activity (rsca) that requires a rapid turnaround due to special circumstances. for more details about this opportunity, please visit the website here . the sjsu office of research offers the rsca seed grant program (formerly known as the csu central rsca grant program) for unit 3 faculty for their research, scholarship and creative activities. funding is provided by the division of research and innovation and, if available, by the csu chancellor’s office. applicants are invited to submit proposals for funding to assist them as they advance an on-going rsca project or as they launch a new avenue of rsca. faculty who receive funding through this program are expected to submit a report on award results, share their accomplishments at a campus-wide event, and serve as a resource for prospective applicants. find more information about this grant here . the sjsu division of research and innovation offers level-up grants to provide an opportunity for faculty to expand their established rsca in new directions through collaboration with sjsu or external partners to develop preliminary data for federal grant proposals. the sjsu division of research and innovation emails faculty when a call for these proposals is made. find more information about this grant here . this is a new funding program for an associate or a late-stage (4+ years) assistant professor to grow a new line of rsca or take an existing line of rsca to a substantially higher level. find more information about this grant here . faculty who have submitted rsca metric data to the college of science may request funds from the just-in-time grant program for any research-related need at any time during the year. the request need only be a brief description of what is needed and how the funds will advance the research agenda of the requester, and a brief budget. please submit requests to science-research@sjsu.edu with the title "jit request". all such requests are reviewed by the cos research committee, which evaluates the merit of the request. evaluations are forwarded to the dean for a final funding decision. we endeavor to release just-in-time funds according to the following schedule: half in the first quarter, one quarter in the second quarter, one eighth in the third quarter, and one eighth in the final quarter. this method balances providing funds early to maximally stimulate research with retaining some funds to meet unforeseen needs. the university grants academy (uga) provides support to faculty members from across the campus over the spring semester in writing a federal grant proposal to fund their rsca. faculty in the college of science typically apply in their first year at sjsu, however all tenure-track and tenured faculty who have not yet received major external grants are eligible to apply. applications are typically due late in the fall semester of the academic year, and are announced by email each year. faculty selected for the uga program receive 3 wtus of assigned time for writing a grant in spring of the following year, and are placed in cohorts of five. each cohort meets weekly with a facilitator, who is a faculty member or administrator with expertise in grant-writing in a related discipline or with the agency to which the uga faculty are applying. throughout the semester, uga faculty learn about and write each section of their grant proposal, while receiving feedback from their facilitators as well as internal (sjsu) mentors in their disciplines who they select. uga faculty also meet the sjsu research foundation staff members who will help them through the grant submission process. toward the end of the semester, the office of research even pays the external reviewer of your choice to review your grant proposal and give you feedback on how to improve it! find additional information about this program here . the sjsu research development group was formed to help faculty increase their external grant funding. headed by dr. julia gaudinski, this group of four research development professionals help faculty with federal grant proposal writing and editing at any stage. the research development specialist who supports the college of science is anna dizack <anna.dizack@sjsu.edu>. find more information here . the college of science provides regular (tenured or tenure-track) faculty with assigned time for mentoring research students as follows: 0.33 weighted teaching unit (wtu) for each undergraduate research student enrolled in 180 courses and 0.5 wtu for each graduate research student enrolled in 297 or 298 courses (or similar graduate research courses appropriate to the department), with a maximum of 3 wtus assignable via this mechanism each semester. the university faculty rsca assigned time program is a university program intended to fund untenured faculty from the time their contractual assigned time for research (described in their offer letter) ends. awardees receive 3 wtus/semester for up to five years based on their application and five-year rsca metric score. to register/apply for this program, faculty must submit registration/application materials when the call is issued, and submit their rsca metric data to the college of science with the application, and each year that they remain in the program. the cos metric, version 2.0 is here [pdf] . the deadline for full applications this year is on march 16th, 2023 by 5pm to science-research@sjsu.edu . the following groups should submit applications: information from the division of research and innovation about this program can be found at this link: https://www.sjsu.edu/research/about/assigned-time-program/index.php  please email me at miri.vanhoven@sjsu.edu if you have questions. please note that all awards are dependent on annual submission of cos rsca metric data each year. probationary faculty finishing their second year at sjsu will be successfully registered in the program if they submit all of their registration materials by the deadline. faculty who are awarded tenure in may, 2023 will be automatically entered into the program without registration materials. for tenured faculty applying to the program, the dean of the cos will make award recommendations to the office of research based on an evaluation of the cos rsca metric, which measures past productivity, and the scholarly agenda, which is a forward-looking document. these recommendations will be based 80% on the 5-year average rsca metric score and 20% on the scholarly agenda. final notice of award will be announced no later than may 18, 2023. each award will be for a 5-year period or until the tenure decision, whichever is less. there will be an annual mini-review of awards and a formal review after year 3 of the award. for example, the first formal review of cycle 1 awards (awards made in ay 2018-19), is in spring 2021. faculty receiving awards must submit information about their scholarly productivity by completing the faculty research activity report (used for submitting rsca metric data) each year in spring (due date will be emailed out annually). faculty who do not submit their data are not eligible to continue the award. in most cases the outcome of the formal review will be that there is no change in the award. if, however, in the dean’s opinion, there has not been adequate progress on the rsca agenda or adequate productivity according to the cos rsca metric, the dean may recommend that the remaining years of the faculty rsca assigned time award be rescinded. the college of science also supplements the university assigned time with additional assigned time awards to the most research active faculty as funding allows, based on the 5-year average rsca metric score. phone: 408-924-4800 email: science-info@sjsu.edu give to the sciences fund
