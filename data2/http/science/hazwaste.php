the following sections are below: • chemical ordering and barcoding • chemical storage: segregation and secondary containment • chemical waste disposal • biohazardous waste disposal attn: pi’s name, dh 435 129 s. 10th street san jose, ca 95112-3619 the cos safety team barcodes all chemicals that are received and delivers them to research laboratories. when a chemical container is empty, remove the barcoded label from the container and place it on the laminated sheet in the chemical container collection bucket, which is provided by the cos safety team to each laboratory. then place the empty chemical container in the bucket. if you accidentally receive any chemicals directly, please contact the cos safety team so that they can pick up the chemical to barcode it and return it to you. sops must be developed for procedures that involve the following: • pyrophorics, • hydrofluoric acid, • carcinogens, • reproductive toxins, and • acute toxins with a high degree of toxicity (e.g., poisons). eh&s has developed a guidance document [pdf] for developing chemical sops that includes links to a list of many chemicals in each of these hazard classes, and information about how to properly dispose of different types of chemicals. a single sop for each hazard class in a teaching or research laboratory is sufficient. template documents for sops for each of these groups of chemicals, and more information on chemical sops is available in the “chemical & laboratory safety” section of the environmental health and safety (eh&s) lab safety webpage . if you would like additional guidance in developing an sop, please contact randy kirchner, kitty nguyen or mike walsh in the cos safety office . all students and laboratory personnel in research laboratories must be trained on the sops and acknowledge this using a signature page (see cos teaching and research laboratory safety training page for more information). the following information is required on all chemical waste labels: phone: 408-924-4800 email: science-info@sjsu.edu give to the sciences fund
