jean sent us the following message to share: as a transfer student to the sjsu physics department, i was welcomed with an active and cooperative community. from the very beginning, i was encouraged to actively participate in department events and attend research seminars as well as join the physics club. the physics club at sjsu is not only a very inclusive organization but also an immensely constructive one. during club functions, we discussed class material, organized outreach events, and promoted department research. through my involvement in the club, i learned of various active research opportunities and, not much later, joined my first research group under dr. aaron romanowsky. the experience and resourcefulness i learned through my research has served me well. through my research group, i learned of campare, a program which connects csu students to various research organizations across the country. after being accepted, i was recruited to intern at the hydrogen epoch of reionization array group at arizona state university. the campare program is closely related to the cal-bridge program which provides students of physics or astronomy with both financial aid and mentorship on applying to graduate programs. it was through the cal-bridge program's support that i would go on to be accepted into the uc davis physics ph.d. program. i could not be more thankful to the sjsu physics department, for not only providing me with career-building opportunities but also for fueling my passion for the field. phone: 408-924-4800 email: science-info@sjsu.edu give to the sciences fund
