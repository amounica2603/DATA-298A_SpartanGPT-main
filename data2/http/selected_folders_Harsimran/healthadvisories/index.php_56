: december 15, 2021 : president mary a. papazian sjsu campus community, on monday, governor gavin newsom announced updates to testing and masking requirements for the state of california that will go into effect beginning today, december 15. although the state’s actions do not impact our mask policy, it may have an impact on those attending commencement ceremonies today through friday. the updated testing requirement necessitates a change in testing for indoor mega events , which have 1,000 or more attendees. beginning today, individuals who cannot provide proof of full vaccination against covid-19 must provide proof of a negative covid-19 test result — administered within two days for pcr tests and within one day for antigen tests — prior to entering the venue. while these updates have been implemented due to an expected rise in covid-19 cases due to the holiday season as well as the emergence of the omicron variant, it is an important reminder that the pandemic is not over. as we celebrate our graduates and prepare for the winter break, remember to wear a mask when indoors or in close proximity of others, wash your hands thoroughly and stay home if you do not feel well or have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for covid-19. sincerely, dr. mary a. papazian president email: healthadvisories@sjsu.edu sign up for alert sjsu
