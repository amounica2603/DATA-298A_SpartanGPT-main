: august 16, 2022 sjsu community, the health, well-being and safety of our campus community continues to be the university’s highest priority. as we prepare to begin the fall semester, we want to provide you with an update about monkeypox (mpx) and sjsu’s response and preparedness efforts and provide some essential information from a q&a that is also available in more detail at the california department of public health website . monkeypox is a disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus which is related to the smallpox virus. while generally less severe and much less contagious than smallpox, monkeypox can be a serious illness. the virus spreads primarily through skin-to-skin contact with people who have monkeypox symptoms such as rash or sores, and may also spread through close, personal contact or exposure to materials contaminated with the virus. no, monkeypox is a completely different disease, is not related to covid-19, and spreads differently. people with mpx are generally contagious when they have a rash or other symptoms, and monkeypox spread takes place through prolonged direct, close contact. this is different from covid-19, which spreads easily through the air. anyone can get monkeypox after having close physical contact with someone who has the infection, especially contact with infected lesions (sores), bodily fluids, or other contaminated surfaces. however, the current risk to the public is low. it spreads primarily through direct contact with infectious sores, scabs, or body fluids, including during sex, as well as activities like kissing, hugging, massaging, and cuddling. monkeypox can spread through touching materials used by a person with monkeypox that haven’t been cleaned, such as clothing, towels and bedding. it can also spread by respiratory secretions (talking, coughing, sneezing, breathing) during prolonged, close, face-to-face contact. monkeypox may start with flu-like symptoms; fever, low energy, swollen lymph nodes, and general body aches. within 1 to 3 days (sometimes longer) after the appearance of fever, the person can develop a rash or sores. the sores will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing. people with monkeypox may experience all or only a few of these symptoms. most people with monkeypox will get the rash or sores. sometimes the sores can be located in places that are difficult for someone to see. some people have reported developing the rash or sores before (or without) the flu-like symptoms. most infections are mild and will resolve without any treatment. there are currently no treatments specifically for monkeypox. however, given that monkeypox and smallpox viruses are genetically similar, antiviral drugs developed to protect against smallpox, such as tecovirimat (tpoxx), may be used to treat monkeypox. vaccines are not recommended for people who have mpx. vaccines are recommended for people who have been exposed to prevent them from developing the disease, and can also be given to those who do not have a known exposure, but are at risk for exposure. at this time, santa clara county public health department has access to the vaccine ( jynneos ) and is prioritizing the vaccine for preventative use for those who are eligible and at high risk. visit the santa clara county public health department monkeypox website for more information on vaccine eligibility. if you are eligible, visit vax.sccgov.org to register for upcoming vaccine clinics. for students looking for support and resources, we encourage you to reach out to the student wellness center with any questions. staff and faculty can reach out to the employee assistance program for support. being aware of the symptoms of monkeypox and how to prevent and treat it is an important step in educating ourselves and the sjsu campus community. we will continue to monitor the situation closely in the days and weeks to come. be well, student wellness center email: healthadvisories@sjsu.edu sign up for alert sjsu
