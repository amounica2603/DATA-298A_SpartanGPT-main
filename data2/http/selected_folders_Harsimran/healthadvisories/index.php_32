march 3, 2021 president mary a. papazian sjsu campus community, effective today, santa clara county moved to the red (tier 2 - substantial) in the state of californiaâ€™s four-tier blueprint for a safer economy . with this move to the red tier, the county is aligning with the state and has lifted most of their directives, including the mandatory directive on travel (which required a 10-day quarantine if an individual traveled more than 150 miles from the county) as well as other directives which affected our overall operations. we are currently assessing the revisions and working toward revising our approach to many programs and activities. sjsu will continue to align with state and county requirements, while safely allowing for increased activity on campus. generally, operations will remain the same, including the spartan food pantry , athletics and research, scholarship and creative activity (rsca) projects. notable changes are: we continue to evaluate other necessary adjustments to campus programs and will provide additional updates as plans are finalized. i would also like to re-emphasize the message from our county health officer. to keep yourself, your family, your friends and neighbors, and our broader community safe, follow these core principles: last week, we shared information about vaccination eligibility for the education sector for residents of santa clara county. yesterday, march 2, santa clara county announced they will offer vaccinations for individuals in the education sector who live or work in santa clara county. this announcement means all employees at sjsu can choose to register to get the vaccine in santa clara county. you can still choose to get vaccinated in your county of residence. the information below is designed to assist you with navigating the pathway to vaccination. we continue to encourage all who are eligible and able to obtain the covid-19 vaccine to do so to protect themselves and their loved ones, as well as the campus and greater community as a whole. please note that the education sector eligibility does not include students unless they are working in the education sector. as more information becomes available regarding student vaccine availability, we will update the campus community. as mentioned in a previous campus message, sjsu and santa clara county were in discussions about space on campus to serve as a vaccination site. after further discussions, it was determined that the site was not best positioned to achieve their goals and sjsu will not serve as a vaccination site. we remain committed to helping our campus community and support the efforts of santa clara county to keep our community safe. sincerely, dr. mary a. papazian president email: healthadvisories@sjsu.edu sign up for alert sjsu
