: february 8, 2021 : president mary a. papazian sjsu campus community, with the county recently returning to the purple (widespread) tier following the lift of the stateâ€™s stay-at-home order, sjsu will be moving forward with the return of face-to-face classes that were already approved to be in that modality for the spring semester on monday, february 15. courses that were not already approved to meet on campus before the start of the semester will remain remote. as we prepare to welcome more people back to campus for the first time since last fall, here are a few reminders to ensure the campus is safe: we are in discussions with santa clara county to serve as a potential vaccination site. details are still being finalized, although the county may include sjsu in a press conference regarding vaccination sites this week. we will update the campus community as soon as there is confirmed information to share. thank you for your continued work in making this semester a successful one. sincerely, dr. mary a. papazian president email: healthadvisories@sjsu.edu sign up for alert sjsu
