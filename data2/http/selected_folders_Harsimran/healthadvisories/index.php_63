: april 11, 2022 : interim president steve perez dear spartan community, it's hard to believe that commencement is only six weeks away. with that goal line clearly in sight, we've reached a decision to continue our indoor mask policy through the end of the semester (may 27). this news may come as a disappointment to some and as reassurance to many others. since the pandemic's arrival in the us early in 2020, we've had to rely on remote instruction for the better part of two years. students who wanted an on-campus college experience instead had to study at home and thousands of graduates had to delay -- or miss altogether -- the opportunity to walk across the stage to collect a hard-earned diploma. even as recently as this semester, we had to delay resuming in-person instruction because covid-19 variants caused another spike in infections and hospitalizations. we know in-person commencement ceremonies are a treasured experience, not only for the graduates but also their families and friends who attend. our most direct path to reaching this goal is by maintaining the practices that have kept us safe. you can see evidence of the effectiveness of masks when you compare the positivity rate for santa clara county , now at 1.8%, to the 0.5% positivity rate for our early post-break testing results on campus. by maintaining a steady course, we can proceed with in-person commencement ceremonies and have more confidence that family members who are elderly, immunocompromised or too young for vaccination are not unduly exposed to risk when they attend. the path through this pandemic has been long and unpredictable. we will continue to provide testing and booster clinics to spot any outbreaks early and strengthen our resilience to the virus. please continue wearing masks indoors and outdoors when in close proximity to others. thank you for your patience and cooperation in keeping fellow spartans safe. with thanks, steve perez interim president email: healthadvisories@sjsu.edu sign up for alert sjsu
