september 1, 2022 interim president steve perez fellow spartans, the new academic year is in full swing and the positive energy around campus is palpable. we are happy to share some positive news about our campus status related to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. based on the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) metrics , covid-19 cases and related hospitalizations in santa clara county have dropped to “medium” level and have remained there for the past two weeks. our policy permits a change to the masking policy if the county remains in the “medium” category or lower for three weeks. given santa clara county’s current status, we expect to adjust sjsu will continue to adhere to required safety measures from the california department of public health and the santa clara county public health department. our overall approach essentially remains the same, based first and foremost on the care, health, and well-being of our campus community. as the situation continues to change and evolve, we’ll adjust and modify our approach, and our decisions about campus protocols and practices. we’ll continue to communicate whenever there are changes to our policies and approaches. thank you, as always, for your flexibility and willingness to adapt. thank you, steve perez interim president email: healthadvisories@sjsu.edu sign up for alert sjsu
