our teacher residency program creates opportunities for our credential students to gain valuable professional experience, ongoing professional development, and significant financial support over the course of an academic year, all while decreasing the amount of time needed to complete a credential program. through effective partnerships with school districts in the region, candidates are paired with mentor teachers and learn how to meet the needs of the students in those districts.  office hours: mon - th | 8am - 12pm; 1- 5pm; fri(online) | 8am - 12pm; 1- 5pm; phone: 408-924-3700 email: specialed@sjsu.edu social media: @sjsulurie
