student-teaching is supervised fieldwork in which candidates are placed in the class of a mentor teacher who guides the development of the candidate's teaching skills and gradually releases responsibility for planning and instruction to the candidate. candidates must submit formal lesson plans and are observed by a university supervisor who provides feedback on their teaching. candidates in the department of special education complete two semesters of student teaching. the first semester of student teaching is considered early fieldwork and candidates complete 200 hours of supervised fieldwork while enrolled in edse 234. the second semester is considered advanced fieldwork and candidates complete 400 hours of supervised fieldwork while enrolled in either edse 217a or edse 154, according to their program roadmap. to be eligible for student teaching, candidates must meet all of the following requirements: department policy further states that students must have a 3.0 gpa and no grades of incomplete to be eligible for student teaching. candidates are not responsible for finding their own student teaching placement. the lurie college of education fieldwork placement coordinator and the special education department chair work together to find appropriate student teaching placements for candidates. candidates have an opportunity to provide input on their student teaching placement and mentor teacher on the student teaching application. the department's top priority is to place candidates with experienced mentor teachers that display the teaching practices we want our candidates to acquire. while candidates may suggest mentor teachers the department does not guarantee placement at any specific site or with any specific mentor teacher. we work carefully to vet all placements for candidates. candidates may complete some aspects of student teaching in a non-public school if there is a qualified mentor teacher and the students served by the school are applicable to the authorization statement of the credential the candidate is seeking. (note: non-public schools are not the same as private schools. the department does not permit candidates to student teach in private schools.) the candidate must still meet the requirement for supervised fieldwork in a general education setting. edse 234 student teaching application - request link from department after submitting bsr, smc, and tb information edse 217a/154 student teaching application - request link from department after submitting bsr, smc, and tb information office hours: mon - th | 8am - 12pm; 1- 5pm; fri(online) | 8am - 12pm; 1- 5pm; phone: 408-924-3700 email: specialed@sjsu.edu social media: @sjsulurie
