we are a student-run organization with the purpose of creating an interdisciplinary network of current san jose state university students and alumni working in the field of early childhood. the group is intended to respond to the needs of students, with activities based on student interest. this hub of student activity may engage in a variety of professional development activities under the guidance of a faculty advisor. for example, students may be interested in learning more about professional practices across the field to inform their knowledge and interaction with young children. this group may also engage in career exploration, with alumni returning to share insights from their own professional paths. the possibilities are endless! we invite you to connect with us: sjsu child and adolescent development undergraduate student minor in deaf education julia doan is a third-year student in sjsu's child and adolescent development program, with research assistant experience and leadership experience working as the president of esan. she has also participated in community service in the city of san jose. she is interested in working as an occupational therapist after finishing her undergraduate degree. sjsu special education graduate student preschool teacher erin maxwell is enrolled at sjsu in the masterâ€™s in education program, with an emphasis in special education. she is also working towards an early childhood special education credential. she has worked as a developmental specialist for young children involved in the child welfare system and is currently a preschool teacher. sjsu business administration and accounting undergraduate student sarah mac is a third-year student in sjsu's business administration and accounting program. she is currently the treasurer for the early childhood student-alumni network and has experience with educating young children as a tutor.
