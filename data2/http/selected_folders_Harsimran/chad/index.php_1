at the sjsu lurie college of education department of child and adolescent development (chad), our programs and faculty provide students with a well-rounded curriculum that incorporates theory, research, policy, and practice. as a result, our students develop an extensive understanding of the major milestones of human development, an awareness of effects of different child-rearing practices or conditions on the fulfillment of development promise, and much more. our students become strong advocates for their communities and transition into several career pathways such as early childhood education, k-12 education, non-profit advocacy, research and policy. view our undergaduate and graduate academic programs undergraduate academic advising - schedule an appointment with an advisor at least once each semester by logging onto spartan connect . subject matter competency (smc) - learn about the departmental procedures to verify subject matter competency and resources provided by the sjsu credential services office. recent alumni kristen huey, kristina smith, and george franco, along with dr. ellen middaugh, were featured on the visions of education podcast to discuss the research project they are involved in, which centers around young people's engagement with news through social media. meet more of our chad students dr. robert marx published “collective memory for queer and trans liberation” in visible magazine! “collective memory and intergenerational connection are the healing antidote to the forces of capitalism, white supremacy, and heteropatriarchy that aim to keep us too busy and downtrodden to see our own capacity to upend systems that work for only a very few. just as i learned about my grandmother’s memories and ways of navigating oppression, so too does learning the ways of life of our queer and trans ancestors offer us a way to radically alter the material conditions which govern our lives and limit us.” view more faculty highlights
