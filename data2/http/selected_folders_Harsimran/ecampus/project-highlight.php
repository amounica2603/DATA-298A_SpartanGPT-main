dr. mark barash, assistant professor, department of justice studies dr. yingjie liu, ecampus this project aims to create an ‘immersive csi experience’ - an assignment that will be incorporated into the forensic science curriculum at sjsu. as a part of this assignment, the students will investigate a mock criminal case by documenting and recording a physical crime scene and creating a virtual crime scene. the students will use various techniques such as a blend of 360 – degrees high-definition photography, video and 2d images complemented with tailored interactivity. the students will conduct the required forensic analyses of the evidence items collected at the scene and document their results and conclusions in a digital expert report linked to the virtual content. this educational activity will place students in simulated scenarios that closely resemble real-world situations and allow practicing with the same technologies implemented by forensic science professionals. dr. jihyun lee, associate professor, department of kinesiology dr. yingjie liu, ecampus the project focused on the possibility of the application of innovative ar/vr technologies in teaching movement skills among children with disabilities. the faculty plan to introduce different ar/vr games as a pedagogical tool to kinesiology undergraduate students who will teach children with disabilities various gross motor tasks. these immersive learning opportunities will improve children with disabilities’ engagement in learning movement skills. dr. kirsten brandt, assistant professor, department of film and theatre dr. yingjie liu, ecampus we are exploring voice and movement training for actors in virtual reality spaces. our investigation includes how actors can use vr as a rehearsal and performance space. dr. ferdie rivera, professor, department of mathematics and statistics dr. yingjie liu, ecampus the vr project on linear algebra seeks to develop vr and ar tools for representing objects and relationships in linear algebra. the tools help enhance students' visual and geometrical understanding. students may also use them to develop conjectures to help them prove and understand processes that could not be easily described in textual form.  phone: 408-924-2337 email: ecampus@sjsu.edu location: irc, room 206 ecampus, irc206 instructional resource center san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0026
