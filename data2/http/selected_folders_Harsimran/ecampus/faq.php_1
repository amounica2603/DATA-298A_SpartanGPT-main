(lockdown browser is a client web browser based on the same system components and settings that also makes up ie on windows and safari on macs.) if the "student early exit" feature is not available, no proctor is available to enter the "proctor exit password" to close lockdown browser, or the system is not responsive to the proctor exit password, the only option is a power down. because many systems put the computer into suspension when pressing the power button once, it will likely be necessary for you to force a power down by holding down the power button for 5 to 20 seconds or longer. usually there is a small "chirp", "click" or "beep" as the local drive heads are locked into transport position and the display discharges during the power down. keep holding down the power button until the computer completely turns off. ignore any messages that may appear on your screen during this process. we recommend the following steps to restore any default settings after a power down. please _do not_ attempt to remove lockdown browser or perform any other restore methods before doing the following steps. to restore the default settings on a windows system: 1. start the system from a power down (not suspension). 2. start lockdown browser 3. immediately quit lockdown browser 4. log out of the windows user account (do not use windows restart) 5. log back into the windows user account to restore the default settings on a macintosh system: 1. start the system from a power down (not suspension). 2. start lockdown browser 3. immediately quit lockdown browser however, if the instructor enabled the option "lock students into the browser until exam is completed " when enabling the lockdown browser requirement in the lockdown browser dashboard, the instructor or proctor will need to use an "exit password" under the "i" button or "about" button in the lockdown browser toolbar to close the browser. at the end of the message, we've included steps to restore with lockdown browser if the system encounters a serious system error. please contact ecampus@sjsu.edu for any further questions. phone: 408-924-2337 email: ecampus@sjsu.edu location: irc, room 206 ecampus, irc206 instructional resource center san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0026
