pdfs are a great format to share content with students. here are some best practices when working with pdfs to make sure they are accessible. (best option!) locate the original file online or work with your department’s library liaison to locate an accessible version. if nothing is available, proceed to option 2. use ally’s alternative formats to convert the document. this option is not perfect and usually requires some remediation. you can also use adobe acrobat dc to “scan/ocr” and “enhance” your document. the result will be similar to ally’s ocred alternative format and usually requires some remediation. tags are essentially markers that provide structure to a pdf. without tags, students using screen readers won’t be able to accurately navigate through the document because there will be no logical reading order. use microsoft word to tag the document. manually tagging pdfs using adobe acrobat dc is not recommended because it has a very high learning curve and is best done by experts in adobe acrobat dc. if interested, see linkedin learning creating accessible pdfs course . note: you must be logged in to view this course. for more detail, see microsoft’s webpage on accessible powerpoints . always use high contrast templates which use dark colored fonts on light backgrounds or vice versa. some high contrast templates are: gallery, retrospect, savon and dividend. you can always check the color contrast using webaim’s color contrast checker . use font size 24pt or above. use the built-in slide layouts, not text boxes. if you use textboxes, you’ll need to manually set your reading order which is quite time consuming. for more details, see microsoft’s webpage on reading order . use unique titles for each slide. for example, two slides about study skills could be named “study skills part 1” and “study skills part 2”. to set the alt text, select the image and right click or select the “format” tab in the top menu. then select “edit alt text”. type a brief description of the image in the box. imagine you are describing it to someone who is blind. for complex images, write a explaining the content and mark the image as “decorative”. if the image is too complex for a caption, include a link to accessible web content, like an article or webpage, or descriptive text-based google document. then mark the image as “decorative.” descriptive hyperlinks provide key information for students; they can easily understand where the link takes them. this is essential for students using screen readers. please remember: select the “review” tab and select “check accessibility”. review the errors and warnings in the accessibility checker panel that automatically opens on the right. make any necessary modifications. to ensure the conversion was successful: phone: 408-924-2337 email: ecampus@sjsu.edu location: irc, room 206 ecampus, irc206 instructional resource center san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0026
