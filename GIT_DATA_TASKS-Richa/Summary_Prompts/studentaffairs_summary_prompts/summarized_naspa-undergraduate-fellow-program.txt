The nasp undergraduate fellow program or nufp for short, is a mentorship and professional development program for students from historically underrepresented andHistorically Disenfranchized populations. Students and mentors are accepted as fellows through the university's coordinating program. If accepted, they become fellows and gain access to scholarship, summer internships, On-Campment Mentorship, and other professional development opportunities. Each student must identify as a representative of a historically underrepresented or historically unenfranched student population; those with a disability and those who identify as either lgbetq or a "racial/ethnic-minoritity background" will not be considered for the national program. However, all students who do not meet the above requirements may still apply for the ufp national program because of the many benefits it provides. As a fellow, you have the opportunity to develop yourself personally and professionally.
