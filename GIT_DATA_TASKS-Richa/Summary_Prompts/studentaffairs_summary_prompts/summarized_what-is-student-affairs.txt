Student affairs is the branch of higher education that deals with all aspects of student life from admissions and advising to graduation and post-graduation services. Many universities offer graduate degrees in student affairs or student services but many positions don't require advanced degree requirements. There are many professional societies for student affairs, including the American Student Affairs Association and the National Association for Student Affairs.
