San Jose State University's student affairs division is working to develop and cultivate relationships with students, faculty, and other members of the campus community. These relationships include sju's annual student conference, which brings together all of the university's academic, government, and community partners in the area; college day at San jose, which takes place every year at the beginning of fall; and the solidarity network, an alliance of student, academic, and governmental organizations that supports student life at the university.
