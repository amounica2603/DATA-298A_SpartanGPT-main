This is a great place to find out what's going on in the school. There are three types of instruction: "fully-on-line," "hybrid," and "in-person." Each type of instruction has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For example, students who take classes in person will have to attend class meetings over the weekends or during the holidays. In other words, there's no need for classrooms all day long.
