construction requests are submitted directly to the university's building permit committee. if the project is not classified as a normal repair and maintenance group, it must go through a "building permit process" or undergo a separate building permit process for projects over $600,000. After the building permit is granted, the project manager prepares a detailed plan and prepares an initial budget. From this point on, the contract is finalized.
