Fdo strives to meet all of the needs of the university by enforcing proper communication between the university and its customers. building representatives, or brs, are appointed by each building's mpp as a means of communicating with the university. Each building has an official br who is responsible for receiving and delivering reports on building problems to the university in a timely fashion. The br receives many requests from the university that must be prioritized based on various factors such as time, cost, and other constraints. When a building does not report a problem, the br sends a message back to the campus community so that they can address the issue directly.
