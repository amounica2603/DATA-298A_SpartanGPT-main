The Alquist Redevelopment is a major part of the university's downtown district. It connects SJSU to the susan, Phil Hammer Theater, and other entertainment venues in the area. The Paseo de San Antonio serves as a central pedestrian pathway between the university and the theater. The paseo also serves as an important link between downtown sans jose and the surrounding entertainment scene. There are two light rail lines that serve both sides of the site: one on the western side and the other on the east. These lines provide easy access to all of the city's business and leisure activities. Nearby, there are numerous restaurants, bars, concert halls, and nightclubs. New developments such as Jay Pauls office tower will bring 5,000 new jobs and 3,000 square feet of housing to the area within a five-minute walk east.
