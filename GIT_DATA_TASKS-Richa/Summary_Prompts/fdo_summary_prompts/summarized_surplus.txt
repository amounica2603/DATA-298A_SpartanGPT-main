The property office must submit a service request for any of the university's property that is no longer needed. If the property is not needed anywhere else on campus, it can be sold. If an item isn't needed elsewhere at SJU but can be used for sale, the use program coordinator will work with the department to submit the service request so that the item can be moved to another location.
