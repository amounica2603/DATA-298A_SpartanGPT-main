This chapter introduces the history of the use of asbestos in the United States, its uses, and its dangers. In the early 1900s, there was a widespread use of it in building materials. It was used in many different applications, including fireproofing, sound protection, and carcinogenic materials. Because of these risks, some of the common materials that were used to build buildings before 1978 were banned from sale. The following buildings are examples of those that may contain asbestos. As long as the building is in good condition, there is no risk of exposure to the "asbestoin fibers" within them.
