The university receives about 13,000 requests every year for maintenance of its buildings, grounds, and other important assets. In order to give proper attention to these requests, the work control center workers assign each work request a priority level based the purpose of the job, the potential impact on the mission, and the overall resources required to complete the work. These priority levels are broken down into five priority levels: immediate threat to life; property; security or environment; urgent situation; and regular maintenance or service items that pose no immediate risk to the university's mission.
