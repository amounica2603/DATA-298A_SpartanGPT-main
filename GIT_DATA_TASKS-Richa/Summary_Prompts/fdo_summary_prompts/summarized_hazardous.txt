The university's hazardous waste management program is a set of rules and regulations that govern the handling, storage, and disposal of all kinds of hazardous materials on campus. All types of waste must be identified with a label on a chemical or product container as soon as it is placed inside an accumulation container. In addition, all chemicals must be labeled with the words "hazard waste, accumulation begin date, Sjsuname & Address, chemical composition, and physical state; and hazardous properties." These labels must also be written on every single-feet-per-container load of waste.
