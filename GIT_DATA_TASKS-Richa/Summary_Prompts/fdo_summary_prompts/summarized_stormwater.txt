As stormwater runs through the university, it collects various types of debris, chemicals and other pollutants that can adversely affect its water quality. The university employs many stormwater management practices to reduce the amount of runoff and improve the quality of its stormwater system. If you have a stormwater problem, please report it to Matt Nymeyer, the university's stormwater manager.
