the narrator uses the example of the San Jos-Santa area to illustrate how the average household income in the San Jose area is calculated. It is the middle point of household wages across the entire range of wage earners in the city. For example, a household with a monthly income of $300 can earn an annual salary of $117900. A household with an annual income of $68500 can earn more than that amount. Workers who make between 80 and 120% of the area's median income are considered "low- income," "extremely low," and "acutely low." This means that many households will not be able to afford their housing. Workforce housing is designed to meet the needs of workers who earn above market-rate rents.
	the narrator explains how rents are being set up in the downtown area of San Jose. He explains that there are still too many unsuitable and overcrowded apartment buildings in the city for students, teachers, and staff to live in.
