"accessible technology" is a term used to describe the use of technology to support people in the classroom, on tests, and even in the privacy of a home. Students are required to attend a virtual meeting with a staff member who will teach them how to use the various types of technology that are available to them. These meetings can be scheduled by sending an e-mail address at the beginning of the meeting or by visiting the cat's training page.
