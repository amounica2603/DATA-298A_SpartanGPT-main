we explain how students with various types of physical and mental conditions can be admitted to the university. Students are referred to as "students with various diagnoses/deaths" because they have no specific medical or mental condition that would prevent them from seeking out the services of the university's accessible education center. These students must submit a written request for an evaluation by a qualified professional who is not involved in the student's education.
