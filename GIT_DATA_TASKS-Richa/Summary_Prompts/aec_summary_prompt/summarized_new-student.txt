San Jose State University does not provide accommodations to students with a disability; however, students may be eligible for some services and accommodations through the same process as other students. Students must first submit an application for admission to the university. After submitting their initial intent to enroll or transfer, students can wait until they are ready to enroll. If they do not meet the eligibility requirements, they will receive an invitation to attend an in-person meeting with an Aec counselor at the university's main office. This meeting will discuss the student's needs and determine whether or not they will be provided with appropriate accommodations.
	Aec's goal is to create a program that will help students with their academic needs.
