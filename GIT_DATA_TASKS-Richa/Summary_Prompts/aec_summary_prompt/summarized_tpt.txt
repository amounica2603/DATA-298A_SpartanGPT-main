In order to help students who are "middle-class" in their traditional classrooms, scholars are discovering new approaches to teaching and learning. These approaches include using technology and alternative forms of learning to encourage and enrich students' learning. For example, a university in Arkansas uses "strategiic alternative learning techniques" to organize courses so that they are more easily accessible for students with learning differences. The cat, an organization that supports students with visual and/or hearing impairments, also uses "advanced technology."
