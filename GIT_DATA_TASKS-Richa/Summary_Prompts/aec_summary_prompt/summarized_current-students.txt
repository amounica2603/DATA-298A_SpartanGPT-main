Aec information about requesting accommodations and testing accommodations in Myaec during the spring and winter of 2023. Each student will receive a faculty notice letter from the instructor telling them that they have been prescribed accommodations. If you do not request these accommodations before the semester starts, your professors will not send out reminders until a few days before the start of the semester.
	students are given the opportunity to discuss their accommodations with their professors and learn how to use them when they have to take final exams. Aec encourages students to speak directly with their instructor in order to request an earlier time for the first exam so that the second exam can be scheduled at a later time. If the instructor does not support such a late time, student should ask for assistance. Students must also submit requests for alternative formats during the course of the semester.
	Aec continues to work with publishers to make sure that students have access to as many different types of material as possible, but this does not mean that all of them will be able to produce the same material in every time.
