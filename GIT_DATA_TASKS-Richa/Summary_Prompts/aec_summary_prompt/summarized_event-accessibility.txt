The Americans with Distinction Act, Section 35.130 requires all special events, entertainment events and social events to be held in "archially accessible locations" including those that are held off-campus. This guide is intended to help you make your events more easily accessible. It also includes a sample of the university's "accessible information exchange," which is an effort to improve the ability of universities to communicate with people with and without hearing aids.
