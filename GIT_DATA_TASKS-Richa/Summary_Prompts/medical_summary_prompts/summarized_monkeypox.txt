San Jose State University's student health center is conveniently located across the street from the university. There's a lot of good information on mpx, including what to do about it. It's also important to know that there's no way you can get mpx from someone who hasn't had a fever or a sore. People can spread the disease through skin contact, as long as they don't get infected with the disease themselves.
