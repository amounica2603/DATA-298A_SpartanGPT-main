San Jose State University has recently updated its covid-19 immunization policy. Students, staff, and faculty should all get vaccinated and report any cases of illness to the university's student health center. If they are not on campus within two weeks, there are no booster vaccines scheduled for students at the student-wellness center. For example, if they are expected to be off campus within the next two weeks or were on campus before that time, there will be no covid 19 booster vaccine services scheduled at the Student Wellness center.
