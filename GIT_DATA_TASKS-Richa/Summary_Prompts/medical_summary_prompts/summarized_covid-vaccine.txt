In the spring of 2023, students must submit proof of their current vaccination status to ensure that they are in full compliance with the CSU's covid-19 immunation policy. If they do not meet this requirement, they will be required to undergo a two-step verification process and may be dropped from classes or prevented from attending. Students who fail to submit the verification process will receive a hold on their account and lose access to university resources.
