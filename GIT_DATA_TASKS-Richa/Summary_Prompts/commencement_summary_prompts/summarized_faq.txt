Spring commencement ceremonies are for students who have completed their degree in spring or summer. The fall commencement ceremony is for graduates who have graduated from the summer term. Latin honors are awarded only to undergraduate students and must be met with the same requirements as graduate students. If a student changes their name after the graduation ceremony, the change will not be recorded on the graduation book; it will be read in the room at the commencement celebration.
