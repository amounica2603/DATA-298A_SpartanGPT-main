The commencement ceremony is a big event for the university. We need your help making it a huge success by volunteering as a commencement crew and helping with other important tasks during the ceremony. If you're interested in helping out before or after the ceremony, please contact your college Dean's Office directly. Faculty Marshals are also welcome to be a part of the student reception team. They'll help students leave and return to their reserved seats during the performance. There's no need for faculty regalia at all.
