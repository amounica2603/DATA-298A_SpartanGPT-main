we'll explain how students can take advantage of grade forgiveness to get ahead in class. Students who have a grade that's too high will be forgiven and can only do one course per course. Gradually, students may start taking courses at different colleges during the fall and spring. Undergraduate students must submit their official transcripts after taking all their required courses. After graduating, students can begin the graduation process by changing their major or adding a minor.
	Undergraduates must submit official transcripts for all courses they have taken at the university. Students who have taken classes at another institution should have their official transcript sent to SJsu. If you have taken more than 12 units in a semester, you must make an appointment to attend classes the next time you want to take them.
