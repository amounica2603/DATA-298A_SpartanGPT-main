Partan connect is a centrally-managed, student-friendly platform that brings together students from all over the university to promote academic progress. In addition, it serves as an information hub for all of the student's personal and academic information. Each term, the advisor community on campus partners with Spartan connect to conduct a "progress report campaign" in which they will send out a series of alerts to students who need additional support.
