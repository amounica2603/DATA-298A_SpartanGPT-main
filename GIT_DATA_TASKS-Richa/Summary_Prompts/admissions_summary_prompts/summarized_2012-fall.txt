All majors at SJSU are impacted by transfers. For fall, all applicants compete to be admitted to the major based on their cumulative Gpa. for transfer students, this means that they have to earn enough transferable college credit to attend the university. If they do not, however, meet the requirements for transfer, they will not be considered for admission.
