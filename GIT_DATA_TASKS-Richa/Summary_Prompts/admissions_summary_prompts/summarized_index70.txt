San Jose State University accepts grades of credit or pass to meet "a-grid" requirements. students who earn college level credit during the summer immediately following their high school graduation will be considered transfer applicants and must meet the university's requirements. if they do not complete their required courses by spring, they may not be offered an admission appointment. If they have taken any other approved college preparatory courses, they will not be counted on as part of the calculation of their grade at the university.
