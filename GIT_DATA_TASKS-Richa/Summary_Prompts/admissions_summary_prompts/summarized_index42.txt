The first step in gaining admission is to check your student services center, which is the official source of information about your academic and career progress. After completing an application through Cal State, you'll receive an e-mail with your 9-Did-Sjsu-id included in it. This will serve as your primary identification during your career at SJsu. To set up your account, go to "the password reset app" and enter the 9-Do-Sign-in-At-One option listed above. Make sure that all your personal information has been updated and that you're using the correct email address. If you need any help, visit our student services office.
