All majors at SJSU are impacted by transfers. All transfer applicants compete for seats in the major based on their cumulative Gpa. All domestic transfer applicants need to submit a separate application for fall admission. For fall 2018, all applicants must have completed at least a combined amount of transferable college courses. If an eligible applicant does not meet the requirements for his or her primary major, then SJU will admit him as an alternate major.
