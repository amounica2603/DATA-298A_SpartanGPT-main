In 4-5 days, you'll receive an admission packet. If you're on an F1 visa, the instructions for changing your academic level will be sent to you. Once your i20 is ready, it's time to get your final documents from the International Student and Scholar services office. Students who have already applied for a bachelor's degree will need to submit their final documents by the due date. If students are planning to pursue a professional license or certificate in another state, they must determine whether they will meet the states requirements for that license or certification.
