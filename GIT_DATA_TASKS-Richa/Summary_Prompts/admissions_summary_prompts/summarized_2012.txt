All majors at SJU are impacted by freshmen. All applicants compete for space in one of the major's majors based on an applicant's "csu eligible index" at time of application, which determines whether or not the major can be counted on to meet the university's limited capacity. For fall 2012, all majors must submit an "eligibility index" of at least 3502, which is calculated using the student's sitting exam or act exam. Majors that require a higher score must have met this standard.
