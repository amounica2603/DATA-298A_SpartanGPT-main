All majors at SJU are impacted by freshmen. For fall 2016, the majors competed for seats in the major based on an applicant's Csu Eligibility Score. This score determines whether or not students will be admitted to the major. Freshmen who do not meet the major's "impaction threshold," but who do meet the university's general eligibility requirements, are offered admission to undeclared.
