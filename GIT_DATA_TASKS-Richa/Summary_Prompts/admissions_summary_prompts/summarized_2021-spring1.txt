The majors at Sjsu compete for seats in the major based on student's cumulative GPA. In addition, all transfer applicants must submit a separate application to be considered for Spring 2021. For this year, only local applicants receive an increase in their GPA as a result of taking advantage of the additional preference given to applicants who earned more transferable college credit during the Prior Filing Period.
	This major does not have the enroll capacity to admit students without course requirements completed, so students can earn a bachelor's degree without having to complete any required coursework.
