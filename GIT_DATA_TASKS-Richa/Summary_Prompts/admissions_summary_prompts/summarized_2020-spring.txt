All majors at SJSU are impacted by transfers. All transfer applicants compete for seats in the major based on their cumulative g pa for all transferably courses completed at time of application; in addition, all local applicants must submit a supplemental application to receive consideration for spring 2020 admittance. For spring 2020, all applicants compete against each other for space as a major. If there is additional available space beyond those who have been admitted as primary majors, then applicants will be admitted as unaccompaniesd. Some majors give preference to applicants who completed "program specific preparatory" courses. These majors do not have sufficient capacity to admit an applicant as an alternate major.
