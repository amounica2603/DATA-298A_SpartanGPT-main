All majors at SJSU are impacted by transfers. For transfer applicants, all majors compete for seats in the major based on their cumulative GPA. In addition, all applicants must submit a supplementary application for fall admission. For fall 2017, all applicants need to have completed at least a certain amount of transferable college courses. If an eligible applicant does not meet the minimum requirements for the individual major, then Sjsu will admit that applicant's application is unaccompanies. Beginning fall 2016, some SJsu programs give preference to applicants who completeprogram- specific preparatory course. These majors do not have the same capacity to admit alternate majors as other majors.
