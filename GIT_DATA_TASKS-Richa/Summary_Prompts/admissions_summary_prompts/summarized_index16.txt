Mysju's supplemental application for transfer applicants will be sent to the university's student services center. For most majors and degree programs, transfer applicants are assigned based on their grade point average at the end of their pre-appealing courses. If two applicants meet with the same rank but have different grades, preference is given to the applicants who have completed the greatest number of preparation courses.
