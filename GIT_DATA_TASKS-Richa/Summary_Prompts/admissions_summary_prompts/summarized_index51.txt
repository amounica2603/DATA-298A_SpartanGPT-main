If you are a citizen, permanent resident, refugee, or any other visa holder, please use the "domestic steps" to apply for admission to San Jose State University. If you have an h1 or f1 visa and wish to convert to a student visa, you must first submit an international application through the Cal State apply process. This step is required only if you intend to study abroad on an extended term. In order to be admitted as an international student, applicants must provide an evaluation of their studies outside the U.S., Canada, or Latin America. These evaluations must be performed by a professional evaluation service that is approved by the university.
	International students must submit an official declaration of financial form, which must be completed by the posted deadline. international students must also submit proof of adequate funds in order to pay for their tuition and living expenses.
