All majors at SJSU are impacted by transfers. All transfer applicants must submit a supplemental application for fall 2016 to be considered. For fall 2016, all majors compete for space on the basis of the student's cumulative Gpa. This applies to all transfer applicants who have completed transferable courses from another college. If they do not complete these courses, they will not be considered for admission to the major. Beginning fall 2016, some Jsu programs give preference to students who completed program specific preparatory course. These majors have the enrollment capacity to admit everyone for fall 2016.
