All majors at SJSU are impacted by the number of freshmen they receive. For fall, however, all applicants compete for seats in the major. Based on an eligibility index calculated by the student's standing on the exam, the university ranks applicants based on their ability to perform well on the test. A preference is given for local applicants with a slight increase in the eligible-eligibility-index calculation.
