San Jose State University accepts international students who have earned bachelors degrees from another country and wish to transfer to the university in the U.S. If you are an international student, you must first complete all your transferable semesters at SJSU before you can graduate. International students must also submit a copy of their financial documents as proof of their academic standing. If they do not meet these requirements, they may be required to take additional courses for credit through open university.
