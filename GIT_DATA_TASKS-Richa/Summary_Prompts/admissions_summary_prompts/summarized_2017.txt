All majors at SJSU are impacted by freshmen. all applicants compete for space in one of the majors, which is based on an applicant's "csu" eligibility score. This score determines whether or not a student will be admitted to the major. For fall 2017, all majors competed for seats in the major; however, only freshmen were admitted. The college offered admission to students who met the university's minimum requirements but who had not met the individual major-eligibility threshold.for fall 2018, non-regular residents must meet the higher standard and have met this standard.the college of engineering did not have sufficient capacity to admit alternative majors.
