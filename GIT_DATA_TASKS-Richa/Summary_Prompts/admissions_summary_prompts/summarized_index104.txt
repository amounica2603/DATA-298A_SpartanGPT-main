Mysju's supplemental application for transfer applicants will be sent to the university's student services center. For most majors and degree programs, transfer applicants are assigned based on their grade at the end of their program-specific preparatory courses. If an applicant has completed more than the required number of preparation courses, the university will give preference to the student with the highest GPA.
