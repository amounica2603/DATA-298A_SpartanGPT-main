San Jose State University is a public, not-for-profit institution that accepts students from all over the world. If you're an international student, you can apply for admission as a "domestic" or "non-disgraced" student and submit your official transcripts to SJU directly. All international degrees must be evaluated through one evaluation service: wes, cee, or acei. The evaluation service will send your degree and grades back to SjU directly after you submit your application. Wes, Cee, and ACEI are only used for applicants who have completed their studies outside of the U.S. or Canada. For example, if you have received a bachelor's education from another country but want to study abroad at SJsu, you'll need to take an exam called the "elective credential evaluation" to meet the university's English language proficiency requirements.
