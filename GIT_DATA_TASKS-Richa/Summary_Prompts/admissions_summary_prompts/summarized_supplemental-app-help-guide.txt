This guide is designed to help transfer applicants complete their supplemental application and get more information about how to prepare for transfer. If you have any questions after reading the guide, please feel free to contact us at admissionsadmins@sju.edu or by chat. The topics in this guide are specific to transfer applicants who wish to change their major once they are admitted. Once they choose their major, they will be required to submit additional requirements before they are approved. To make sure that all of your transferable courses are counted as transferable, we recommend that you calculate your grade points on your transcripts. For example, if you attend a quarter college, you should not convert the unit to semester units; however, some colleges will use a counting system to identify which courses are "transferable" to a university. In addition, we're running a pre-argument assessment of your eligibility to Sjsu so that you don't have to worry about changing your major once you're admitted.
	we explain how you will be able to meet the requirements for an associate degree at San Jose State University. If you have not completed all of the required courses in your college's program, you can submit a supplemental application on the SJSU's web site.
