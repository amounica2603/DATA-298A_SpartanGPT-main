All of the requirements for a bachelor's degree at San Jose State University are met. If you have taken an English language proficiency exam, you must meet the university's "csu" requirements. For example, if you took "o level examinations," you must pass them with "a" or "a higher score." Otherwise, you will not be allowed to take college credit on the exam. In addition, all of the majors at SJsu are competitive because there are more qualified students than there are new students.
