you'll learn everything you need to know about the university's admission process. First, you should meet with your English teacher and learn about the requirements for international students. After that, you can submit official scores to demonstrate your English language proficiency. If you're a student at another university outside the U.S., you will have to submit a score of "electrified" or "toefl" in order to demonstrate how well you speak English.
