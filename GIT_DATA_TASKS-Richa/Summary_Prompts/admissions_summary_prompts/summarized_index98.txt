if you're a student who's been at SJU for a while and hasn't yet been admitted to the university, you may be asked to reappear as an excuse. If you've already been accepted into the university and are still unsatisfied with it, you can submit a petition for reconsideration. However, this process is only for students who meet the transfer requirements.
