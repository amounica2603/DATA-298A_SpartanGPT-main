San Jose State University is now accepting applications for transfer students. All transfer students must submit a "supplemental" application, which will include their fall grades, as well as any other requirements that may be met during the student's transfer period. If a student has earned an associate in arts or associate in science degrees for transfer, but does not meet all of the admission requirements, he may be admitted to a similar bachelor's degree program.
