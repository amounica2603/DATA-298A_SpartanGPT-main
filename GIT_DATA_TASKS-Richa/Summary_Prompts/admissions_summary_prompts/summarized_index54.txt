San Jose State University is now competing with all majors in the state to find students who will be able to attend. For freshmen and transfer applicants, they are considered "local applicants" if they have graduated from a local high school or a community college. All other applicants are encouraged to apply at an alternative college that offers their preferred major. In order to be considered impaction-effaced, applicants must meet the minimum requirements of each major. additional consideration will also be given to veterans, first-generation college students, and military spouses.
