Refunds are accepted throughout the semester, and students do not need to request a refund from the university. If a student has a balance on their account that is greater than the amount of tuition and fees charged to cover the balance, they will receive a full refund. Students who withdraw from classes after the initial day of instruction or after the last day of attendance are subject to "pro-rated charges." students who drop their classes during the cut-off period but remain at the university will be entitled for a reduced fee structure.
