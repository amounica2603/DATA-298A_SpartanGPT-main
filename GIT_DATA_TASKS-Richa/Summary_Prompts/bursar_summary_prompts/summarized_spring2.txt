Students who drop all or part of their classes will receive a full refund. students who withdraw after and who do not remain enrolled will be subjected to apro-rata charge, which is calculated based on how much the student owes the university. If a student receives a financial aid refund but does not withdraw from all his classes, the student will be responsible for repaying the university's refunded amount.
