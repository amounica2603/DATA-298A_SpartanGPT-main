Sjsu doesn't offer on-campus transportation, but does offer paratransit services for eligible individuals with a disability who can't ride a bus or light rail to their service area because of their physical, vision or mental health issues. Paratransit is offered through the vaaccess program, which offers shared rides in the vaservice area during the regular operating times.
