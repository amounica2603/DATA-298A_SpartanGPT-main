Short-term car rental is now available at SJSU. Students and employees can save money by signing up for annual memberships when they sign up with their SJU address. These discounts are a great way to save money on long-term trips. If you're looking for something more than short-term, however, you can rent a car through the zipcar system. There's also a flat-rate-only policy that allows students, teachers, and other members of the university to reserve rides for longer periods of time. This is a good way to cut back on how long it takes to get from station to station.
