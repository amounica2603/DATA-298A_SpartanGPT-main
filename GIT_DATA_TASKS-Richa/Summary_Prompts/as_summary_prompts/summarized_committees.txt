As a student at large member of the university's student committees, you have an opportunity to make important decisions about how the university is run and how it is run for the benefit of all students. If you're interested in running for office on one of these committees or becoming involved in some other aspect of student government, don't hesitate to apply.
	The university's personnel committee meets to discuss grievances and other matters. It is composed of representatives from the student union, the university administration, and outside auditing companies.
