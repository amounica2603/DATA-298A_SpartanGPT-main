"legacy month" is a month-long celebration of student activism and civic engagement. Each year, the college celebrates with a day of festivities. In honor of the pioneering work of student groups like the SJsu Athletic Club and the Olympic Gold Medalist, the campus community gathers on October 13 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic fight between Tommie Smith and John Carlos.
