The smartpass is a card that allows students and employees to ride public transportation in Sanserio without having to purchase a ticket. All direct lines to SJsu aren't express, so there's no charge for using the smartpass on express lines. There's only one catch: you can't use any other transit service in the bay area. If you don't have your smartpass tagging correctly, the pass won't work.
