Sju has a new ride-night pilot program that allows students and employees to ride to the station during the evening. If you're looking for a ride, just call the upd transportation line at 408-924-6000. Upd will arrange the ride for you. There's also a free safety app called "vta" that lets you report safety concerns directly to the police or in an emergency directly to them. Bart watch is another free app that can help you report suspicious activity to the bart police directly. It also has an alert system that sends out service advisories whenever trains are late or delayed.
