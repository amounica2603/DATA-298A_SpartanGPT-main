A trip plan is a guide of how to get from one station to another. Some of the most frequently visited destinations are located near SJ U. E., but there are some that aren't well-known. For example, you might want to take a train to the international airport and then return to the station by reverse directions. If you're looking for directions to a shopping mall, just follow these steps.
	board a train at the station and wait for it to pull out of the station. Once there, you can pick up an orange line or yellow line train that will take you towards richmond/describbark and then back to the city. From here, you'll have to board another one of the many different bus lines that will get you to your destination.
