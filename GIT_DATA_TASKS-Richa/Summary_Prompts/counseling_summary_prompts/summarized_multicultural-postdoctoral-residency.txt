This program is designed to provide a well-respected and experienced mental health professional with the opportunity to practice in a large, diverse university counseling center. Postdoctoral students will have the following duties: short term individual, group and couples counseling as well as possible supervision of psychologists and interns. They will also be expected to develop an interest in "cultural diversity" through their involvement in various forms of teaching and supervision. These activities include attending social justice and community outreach seminar, attending a supervision or professional education seminar, providing supervision to the psychological intern group supervision and may have additional supervision provided by co-familiarizing with an internship and practicum student. The training committee decides on supervisors for the second year and makes final decisions about whom to hire.
	Postdoctoral Residency During the first year of the program, students will attend various meetings. They will also have the opportunity to participate in a special project related to their interest area. The training coordinator and the training coordinator will meet with postdocs during the fall semester so that they can connect them to the appropriate partner on campus
