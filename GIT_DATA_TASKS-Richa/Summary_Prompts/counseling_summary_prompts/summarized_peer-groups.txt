This chapter introduces several different kinds of groups that will help students develop friendships and learn new skills. Some of these groups require student sign-up, so students should visit the student health center patient portal to learn more about them. a support group for international students will be held at the university's student wellness center. If you are interested in joining this group, please contact Minji or Saima. They will meet up once more to discuss how to get started.
