The goal of the psychology internship program at San Jose State University is to train postdoctal residents and psychology interns in counseling and mental health. Specifically, the training emphasizes "cultural awareness and humility" while emphasizing "separable levels of training" that all students will have different needs. For example, some students will be separated from one training activity while others will meet together for other training activities.
