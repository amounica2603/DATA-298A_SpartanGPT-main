San Jose State University is now offering services through "telemental health," which means that students can receive services from a counselor anywhere in the state. Students who live outside of the state can also receive services, but they are not allowed to use crisis intervention services or attend our workshops. In order to provide more mental health services to students at the university, there is a limit on how many counseling sessions students can have in a year.
