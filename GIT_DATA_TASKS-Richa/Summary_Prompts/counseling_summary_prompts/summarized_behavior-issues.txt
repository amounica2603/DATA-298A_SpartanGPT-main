the Vice President for Student Affairs explains how to respond to students who are disrupting their studies and making them uncomfortable. It is important that faculty and staff be aware of what kinds of behavior can be expected from students before they become dangerous or out of control. If a student behaves in a way that makes it unsafe for him or anyone else on campus, call the University police department at 4008 924 2222 immediately.
