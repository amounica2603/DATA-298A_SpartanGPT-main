The culminating experience requirements for master's and doctorate degree programs are described in this chapter. students must complete a final paper or project, an examination, or a creative assignment. If the student fails to meet these requirements, they will not be allowed to list their degree with a pass grade on their SJU transcript. Students who do not meet the requirements through a "special creative assignment" must submit a report on the completed assignment.
