Graduation is the final step of a student's degree. students must complete all required courses with a minimum grade point average in order to graduate. If a course does not meet graduation requirements, students can submit a request for an extension of time. Students must also attend a graduation ceremony.
	Graduation reviews are scheduled for fall, spring, and summer. After graduation, students have two options: they can receive their degree immediately or wait until the end of their review period to receive it. If they plan to move after graduation, they should keep their preferred address up-to-date.
