A graduate student may be admitted provisionally to the university if all of the required documents are cleared. However, if they have not yet cleared their provisional status, they will not be allowed to attend the fall and spring semesters. If they have taken a course outside of the university that does not contribute to their degree, they must submit an official transcript. Students may take one or two semesters off without returning to school; however, students must complete at least 70 percent of the courses included in their proposal in residence at SJsu. transfer credit can be granted as long as it is validated. students who have been admitted conditionally-classified must meet with their graduate advisor to change their status from "conditional" to "classified" before advancement to candidacy.
