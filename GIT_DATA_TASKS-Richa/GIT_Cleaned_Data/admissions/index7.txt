the writing skills test (wst) is part of a csu system-wide graduation requirement to assess your writing ability and determine whether further coursework in writing is required prior to graduation. the writing skills test is not an admission requirement. however, we strongly encourage all incoming transfer students to take the wst before transferring to sjsu.beginning fall 2021, sjsu suspended offering the writing skills test (wst) and created an alternative process to meet the wst requirement called the wst directed self placement (dsp).if you have not participated in the wst or dsp by the end of your first semester at sjsu, a registration hold will be placed on your student account, preventing you from signing up for courses in future terms. all upper division (junior and senior level) students must pass the wst in order to register for sjsu studies general education courses. failing to pass the test will delay your graduation, but will not affect your admission status.interested in applying to an undergraduate program or visiting campus, visit our undergraduate student outreach and recruitment office website.interested in applying to a graduate program or have questions about applying, visit our graduate enrollment management office website.408-283-7500 monday to friday 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.(icon at the bottom right corner)monday - friday, 9 a.m. - 12 noon and 2 - 4 p.m.bachelor's degrees and undergraduate admissions only join the queue to speak with us virtually!due to a high volume of emails currently, please expect delays admissions@sjsu.edu student services center (ssc)one washington square san jose, ca 95192 san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0016 san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0017
