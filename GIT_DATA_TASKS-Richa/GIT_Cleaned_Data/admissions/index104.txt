a supplemental application will be assigned in mysjsu to transfer applicants to collect any additional information required to complete the admission process.for most majors (degree programs), transfer applicants are ranked by self-reported gpa per degree program and admitted in sufficient numbers to meet the capacity for that program. since fall 2016, select degree programs started admitting students based on a combination of their self-reported gpa and the completion of program-specific, lower division coursework.for these select programs, if two applicants to the same program have the same gpa, preference will be given to the applicant who has completed the greater number of program-specific preparation courses. similarly, if two applicants have completed the same number of program-specific preparation courses, preference will be given to the applicant with the higher gpa.interested in applying to an undergraduate program or visiting campus, visit our undergraduate student outreach and recruitment office website.interested in applying to a graduate program or have questions about applying, visit our graduate enrollment management office website.408-283-7500 monday to friday 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.(icon at the bottom right corner)monday - friday, 9 a.m. - 12 noon and 2 - 4 p.m.bachelor's degrees and undergraduate admissions onlyjoin the queue to speak with us virtually!due to a high volume of emails currently, please expect delays admissions@sjsu.edu student services center (ssc)one washington square san jose, ca 95192 san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0016 san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0017
