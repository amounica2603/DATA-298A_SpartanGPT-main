the role of your graduate advisor to submit the verification of culminating experience form on your behalf at the end of the semester for which you intend to graduate. however, it is the responsibility of the student to confirm the use of the form in conjunction with their program and ensure the form has been submitted to the gape office. for students who are only required to conclude

[pdf].continuous enrollment is required of all graduate students between completion of regular courses and satisfactory completion of the culminating experience. enrollment must be maintained in each fall and spring semester until degree completion. graduate students may maintain enrollment by registering fora 1-unit 1290r course or by registering for other courses.please note that departments may require repeated enrollment in a project, thesis, or comprehensive exam-preparation class. consult with your graduate advisor for additional instruction to successfully maintain continuous enrollment.for detailed information, visit the university catalog for the continuous enrollment policy.eligible graduate students will be notified by the registrars office after the add deadline for the given semester.students will be assigned a special session appointment for the 1290r course and they may then register online through their mysjsu portal. no permission or add code is necessary to register for the 1290r course.as the course is supervisory in nature, there are no formal meetings for 1290r. the enrollment allows students to maintain an active status (utilizing campus resources) while completing their culminating experience. students are encouraged to register as soon as the mysjsu appointment is available; however,registration for 1290r must occur prior to the last day of course instruction for the given term.note for international students: to maintain their immigration status, international students are encouraged to add the course as soon as their appointments are available and within 30 days.continuous enrollment is a university graduation requirement. therefore, failure to register for this unit will result in a hold on graduation until the 1290r unit is retroactively added in each fall and spring term lacking required enrollment. at that time, late fees will apply.to retroactively add a 1290r course, the student is required to complete anonline retroactive requests for 1290r form, available at the registrar's website and payment of associated tuition and fees.(408) 924-2480 graduate@sjsu.edu visit our connect page for additional contact
