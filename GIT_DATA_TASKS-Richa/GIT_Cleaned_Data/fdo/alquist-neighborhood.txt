below is contextualizing details for the alquist redevelopment as it relates to the surrounding area. for any questions or concerns not addressed here, email workforcehousing@sjsu.edu.the paseo de san antonio is a four-block, central pedestrian walkway in downtown san jose that connects san jose state university with plaza de csar chavez. the paseo links sjsu and the susan and phil hammer theatre, which the university operates, with various live entertainment venues, public event space, eateries, and hotels in the immediate vicinity of the san jos convention center.as the core pedestrian promenade in san jos, the paseo is a vital arterial connection for the downtown area and a defining fixture of the core of san joss entertainment scene. the alquist redevelopment will anchor the eastern end of the paseo and, on the opposite end, several new developments such as westbank and urban communitys park habitat and jay pauls 200 park avenue will breathe new life onto the western end of the paseo. this project aims to be part of a wave of sustainably designed and built towers that exemplify the values of smart, efficient, and dense land use in a downtown core used to seeing low to mid-rise development.the santa clara valley transportation authority operates two light-rail lines through downtown san jos. both blue line and green line trains, with southbound services to south san jos and campbell respectively, stop on the opposite side of third street at san antonio station on the western boundary of the alquist redevelopment site.northbound trains to north san jos for both lines stop on second street, one block west of the site. proximity to these lines offer efficient, affordable one-seat, transferless rides to north san jos corporate campuses, providing easy access for residents to samsung, paypal, and cisco.the adjacent access to public transit aligns with the state, county, city, and university priorities to reduce vehicle miles traveled, or vmt - a metric of single-rider automobile travel which contributes to carbon emissions and traffic congestion.various regional commuter rail services operate through san joss diridon station, a major railway hub that includes caltrain, the commuter rail linking santa clara county and san mateo county cities with san francisco.ace, or altamont corridor express, trains connect the area with stockton through inland east bay cities, andamtrak runs coastal starlight and capitol corridor trains through diridon station.with the impending arrival of bay area rapid transit, bart, and california high speed rail, diridon station aims to become a grand central station of the west coast with the alquist redevelopment site located within one and a half miles east.various vta bus lines and vta light rail trains currently connect the alquist redevelopment and the sjsu main campus to diridon with one-seat rides lasting fewer than ten minutes.the alquist redevelopment site is uniquely situated both between the vibrant urban core of san jos and san jos state universitys main campus, simply a five minute walk east. various restaurants, cafes, bars, and live entertainment venues such as theaters, performance spaces, nightclubs, and conference and meeting venues are all within walking and rolling distance from the site.comprehensive bike lanes allow both bicycling and scooter connections to downtown amenities already present for future residents.on the other end of the paseo de san antonio, corporate headquarters for adobe and zoom are within walking and bicycling distance. other major companies such as cisco, paypal, and samsung have headquarters accessible via via bicycle lanes and bus and light rail lines to north san jos.new developments such as jay pauls 965,000 gross square feet office tower 200 park avenue and westbanks and urban communitys 1.3 million sf mixed-use, net zero carbon tower are bringing a renewed sense of vibrancy to the downtown community. within the next decade, googles downtown west live-work campus will bring 25,000 new jobs to the immediate vicinity along with 4,000 units of housing across a sprawling multi-purpose campus one and a half miles west of sjsus main campus. this project aligns with a wave of investment and high levels of attention towards an ever-densifying and expanding downtown san jos.major silicon valley corporations and companies are within commute distance either through vta light rail service to north san jos campuses; caltrain service to sunnyvale, mountain view, palo alto, and downtown san francisco; one-seat train rides on bart to fremont, oakland, and san francisco; and nearby freeway access to i-280 and i-880 and u.s. highway 101.surrounding apartment complexes remain far and few between and almost exclusively contain market-rate housing units. among the tallest buildings in the area, across from the 18-story city hall, is a 28-story residential tower of market rate apartments, while the remaining properties surrounding sjsu are low to mid-rise complexes which offer little to no forms of rental subsidies to educators and students.due to the height restrictions set by the federal aviation administration as a consequence of downtowns proximity to mineta san jose international airport, most buildings in san jos do not rise to a height greater than 390 feet. however, due to the high cost of construction and the difficulties associated with the housing approval process, most apartment complexes in the area are well below the maximum building height. apartments around sjsu rise to, on average, no greater than seven stories.the alquist redevelopment project aims to maximize the benefit of the land granted by the state of california to sjsu by ensuring the site can accommodate as many units of housing that will allow the greatest number of sjsu-affiliated residents to call the location home. current plans envision a roughly 300-foot, 24 story residential tower with a mix of both workforce and market-rate housing units.while few and far between, several other residential towers exist within walking distance of the site. the downtown san jos plan sets, by city law, a minimum requirement for new construction to include at least 800 dwelling units per acre of land developed. this project exceeds that minimum to take advantage of scarce land and an extenuating shortage of housing units in the immediate area and wider region.located in:corporation yard office hours:monday - friday, 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.saturday and sunday, closed
