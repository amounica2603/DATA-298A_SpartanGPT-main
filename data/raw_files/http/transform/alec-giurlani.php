while i was a student at sjsu, i was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer by dr. hidalgo in the health center. i was only 21 at the time and scared of what was to come from my diagnosis. however, dr. hidalgo was supportive during my time at sjsu while i received care from stanford hospital. my boss at the time, gisela gray-peoples, and the entire college of humanities and the arts were so understanding and worked with me through my whole cancer journey.i never expected sjsu to be such a kind and loving family that supported me throughout my entire academic time. thankfully, i am more than five years cancer-free and working full time at sjsu! working at san jos state showed me how wondering this university truly is. i am grateful for the entire university and the opportunity to give back as an academic advisor!
