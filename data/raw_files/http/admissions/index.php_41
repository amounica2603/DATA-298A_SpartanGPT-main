?sjsu doesdeem many 3-year bachelors degrees from india, australia, and many canadian provinces as comparable to a 4-year u.s. bachelors degree.however, you may choose to continue your education in your home country at an accredited university and earn a master's degree or postgraduate diploma in the same or related field as your 3-year bachelor's degree. if you earn the master's degree or postgraduate diploma, our office will need evidence of graduation (i.e. degree certificate) in order to verify its successful culmination. please note that a 3-yr bachelor's degree from your home country and a master's degree or postgraduate diploma from another country, is not considered equivalent to a 4-yr bachelor's degree in the u.s.if you remain in the united states, it is recommended that students with a three-year degree apply for undergraduate admissions at a four year regionally accredited college or university as an upper division (junior or senior level) transfer student and complete a bachelor's degree. depending on how many transfer units are awarded, it should take about two years of full-time study to earn a u.s. bachelor's degree. if you decide to do this, please make an appointment with an undergraduate admissions counselor at the college you plan to attend who works closely with international transfer students. to meet with an admissions counselor at san jos state, go tostudent outreach and recruitmentto view the pre-admission counseling hours or call 408-924-2564.for those that hold abologna degree, please note that sjsu will accept and require a proper wes, ece, or acei international evaluation.interested in applying to an undergraduate program or visiting campus, visit ourundergraduate student outreach and recruitment office website.interested in applying to a graduate program or have questions about applying, visit ourgraduate enrollment management office website.408-283-7500monday to friday 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.(icon at the bottom right corner)monday - friday, 9 a.m. - 12 noon and 2 - 4 p.m.bachelor's degrees and undergraduate admissions onlyjoin the queueto speak with us virtually!due to a high volume of emails currently, please expect delaysadmissions@sjsu.edustudent services center (ssc)one washington squaresan jos, ca 95192san jose state universityone washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0016san jose state universityone washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0017
