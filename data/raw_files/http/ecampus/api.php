api, an abbreviation of, is a set ofroutines, protocols, and tools for buildingsoftware applications. a good api makes it easier to develop aprogramby providing all the building blocks. aprogrammerthen puts those blocks together.mostoperating environments, such asms-windows, provide an api so that programmers can write applications consistent with the operating environment. although apis are designed for programmers, they are ultimately good forusersbecause they guarantee that all programs using a common api will have similar interfaces. this makes it easier for users to learn new programs.an apispecifieshow somesoftware componentsshould interact with each other. in practice, most often an api is alibrarythat includes specifications forroutines,data structures,object classes, and variables. an api specification can take many forms, including an international standard, vendor documentation such as themicrosoftwindows api orthelibrariesof aprogramming language. an api differs from anapplication binary interface(abi) in that an api is source code based while an abi is a binary interface.information about canvas api [pdf]information aboutcanvas lms api documentationinformation about canvas lmsphone:408-924-2337email:ecampus@sjsu.edulocation: irc, room 206ecampus, irc206instructional resource centersan jose state universityone washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0026
