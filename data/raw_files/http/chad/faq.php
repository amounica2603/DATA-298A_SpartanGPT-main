talk with your instructor about how you could improve your performance in the class.sometimes faculty are working on research projects and if you can ask them if there are opportunities for you to be involved with their projects. chad faculty can also answer questions about the various careers and educational pathways (e.g., graduate school) you can take after graduating from sjsu.sometimes instructors and students disagree on assignments or grades. there can also be issues about the lecture/discussions, interpersonal contacts, etc. difficulties can occur in chad or in any other department on campus. if you disagree with an instructors decision or conduct, here are some options:the first thing you should consider doing is immediately to make an appointment to talk privately with your teacher. try to resolve the problem by being candid and clear about what the issues are.if you are not comfortable talking with your instructor or after you have spoken with your instructor, you still feel that the issue is not resolved, make an appointment to discuss the situation with the department chair. for chad go to sh 201 and make an appointment with the department chair.after you have met with the chair or if you have concerns that make you feel that you cannot discuss the problem with the department chair, continue the discussion in one of two ways:make an appointment to talk with the associate dean of the college in which the department is located (for chad this would be the college of education, sh 103) ormake an appointment with thesjsu ombudspersonalternatively, you
