california commission on teacher credentialing pupil personnel services program standards, 2015, the complex needs of todays students emphasize the need for comprehensive counseling and guidance programs in schools. the foundation of the school counseling profession contains knowledge and professional attitudes that promote student development, learning, and achievement. future school counselors must have knowledge of the history as well as current trends in school counseling that is often achieved through active participation in professional organizations. they must also have knowledge of the laws and ethics of counseling specific to children in california schools.effective school counseling is further supported by knowledge of state and national standards for school counseling and by familiarity with models of effective comprehensive school counseling and guidance programs. the goal of comprehensive school counseling and guidance programs is to increase student learning and achievement by promoting student development in three domains: academic development, career development, and personal and social development. school counselors must be knowledgeable of these domains and familiar with models of school counseling and guidance programs (e.g., multi-tiered multi-domain system of support) that include desired student competencies and means of effectively attaining measurable student outcomes. it is essential that school counselors are skilled in the development, implementation, and delivery of comprehensive and developmental school counseling and guidance programs that effectively address each domain.the school counseling profession is directed toward increasing students learning and achievement and focusing on enhancing the teaching and learning processes. school counselors work as leaders in the promotion of student learning and achievement. they serve as advocates for equal opportunity and access to a quality education including support for high learning expectations and standards for all students.a child welfare and attendance (cwa) specialization is a supplemental authorization that can be completed.according to the 2015 california ctc pupil personnel services program standards, child welfare and attendance professionals are skilled trouble-shooters in correcting average daily attendance (ada) leaks. concerns and

and procedures associated with building maximum levels of school attendance, the child welfare and attendance specialist is needed to make corrective efforts. the cwa specialists usually access appropriate services from both public and private providers, including law enforcement and social services; provide staff development to school personnel regarding state and federal laws pertaining to due process and child welfare and attendance laws; address school policies and procedures that inhibit academic success; implement strategies to improve student attendance; participate in school-wide reform efforts; and promote understanding and appreciation of those factors that affect the attendance of culturally-diverse student populations. cwa programs cover the professional role of cwa, laws
