if you are a faculty member teaching a writing-intensive course, you can apply for a course-embedded tutor. course-embedded writing tutors are a form of supplemental instruction, and they are a valuable resource for your students throughout the writing process. they are more skilled and knowledgeable than their peers they are fully trained and supported by the writing centerand they work three hours per week exclusively with your students. faculty members and course-embedded writing tutors work out a flexible schedule within the following guidelines:within these guidelines, faculty members and course-embedded writing tutors work together to decide how this time should be allocated. faculty with course-embedded tutors also participate in a paid writing across the curriculum (wac) workshop that explores both genre theory and practical tips/best practices for working with an embedded tutor. we do our best to accommodate faculty applications, but please keep in mind that (1) demand for this service is high, and (2) sometimes tutor-faculty schedules do not match (e.g., the tutor has their own class at the same time as the course for which you're requesting an embedded tutor). we will be accepting applications again late in the spring 2023 semester (for fall 2023). be sure to check this page, and when applications are open, there will be a blue "apply now!" button below that will lead you to our form.
