jean sent us the following message to share: as a transfer student to the sjsu physics department, i was welcomed with an active and cooperative community. from the very beginning, i was encouraged to actively participate in department events and attend research seminars as well as join the physics club. the physics club at sjsu is not only a very inclusive organization but also an immensely constructive one.during club functions, we discussed class material, organized outreachevents, and promoted department research. through my involvement in theclub, i learned of various active research opportunities and, not much later, joined my first research group under dr. aaron romanowsky. theexperience and resourcefulness i learned through my research has servedme well. through my research group, i learned of campare, a programwhich connects csu students to various research organizations across thecountry. after being accepted, i was recruited to intern at the hydrogen epoch of reionization array group at arizona state university. thecampare program is closely related to the cal-bridge program whichprovides students of physics or astronomy with both financial aid andmentorship on applying to graduate programs. it was through thecal-bridge program's support that i would go on to be accepted into the uc davis physics ph.d. program. i could not be more thankful to thesjsu physics department, for not only providing me with career-buildingopportunities but also for fueling my passion for the field.phone: 408-924-4800email:science-info@sjsu.edugive to the sciences fund
