appointments in cpge managed sessionswinter term, summer term (non-state support), and special sessionrequire review by the up - fs additional employment team. the"upfs additional employment" form found in onbasewill be used for making cpge appointments and for compensating the faculty after the appointment period ends. gone is the old 2-stage process using 2 formsone for appointments and the other for payments (vouchers).after approval by additional employment, the 'upfs ae form' will be retained by cpge. cpge will verify and update the form's informationincluding payment amountafter the appointment ends. finally, cpge routes the form to the ess team for payroll processing.cpge teaching and non-instructional appointments must be made on a per faculty member basisone cannot appoint multiple faculty on the same form. however, one may request multiple appointments (e.g., more than one class) for the same faculty member on one form. however, payment is issued only after the "appointment end date" for all appointments on one form.submit more than one appointment form if payment is expected after each class is completed (e.g., first summer session, second summer session).changes to appointments (e.g., a class is canceled) will require submitting a revision of the faculty member's assignment using another upfs additional employment form with the appointment type: revision.special session appointments are for academic programs not supported by the state general fund that are provided to matriculated students on a self-support basis and often with atypical times and locations determined by the program. select special session as the form type in the upfs ae form.special session appointments often put faculty into overload appointment status (over 1.0 fte). however, special session appointments may also be made for volunteers, banking time, or split-funding (buyout of state funded workload by the special session program).these appointments are generally approved as overload appointments with these caveats:the special session form type may also be used to appoint faculty to non-instructional duties during the sessionduties that serve the special session program's students and programming. however, teaching and non-instructional appointments must be made on separate forms.appointments in special session are "extension for-credit employment" (article 40, unit 3 cba), and they are in classification code 2322. the salary for classification code 2322 is determined by rank, wtus for a class, and number of students in that class. some programs have waivers that allow for higher compensation. waivers are obtained from the office of the provost.it is important to maintain the distinction between special session program duties and summer and regular session duties. sometimes faculty teaching in special session programs during the summer are mistakenly appointed as summer session faculty, leading to improper pay and improper accounting. departments may also forget that split-funded appointments require buyout (transfer of funds) from the special session program to the stateside ledger.for more information about special

on additional employment. therefore, appointments may not lead to faculty timebase or workload exceeding 1.25 fte, or 50 hours per week. summer appointments are always added to existing appointments.
