the selection committee:the composition of your committee is critical to a successful search:nothing is more fundamental to the selection process than confidentiality of information. confidentiality protects the process, identities and relative ranking of individual applicants.confidentiality requires that committee members refrain from discussing the status of any application, information learned from any document and information learned during the interview. this information is privileged even after the search is over and the employee is hired. the information is not for public disclosure.each committee member is viewed as an agent of the university. during the selection process, it is important to prevent a liability for the university or for individuals. members who disclose privileged information run the risk of involving themselves and/or the university in potential legal action.if you have any questions, please contact your recruiter (seeyour up representativesfor your specific recruiter by department.).university-personnel@sjsu.eduup north:408-924-2450up south:408-924-2250up webmasterup northadministration building 242up southupd building 3rd floor
