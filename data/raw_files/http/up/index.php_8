under the terms of the current csu-cfa agreement, ferp is an entitlement program, as long as the relevant procedures are followed and courses appropriate for the faculty member to teach are scheduled.tenured instructional faculty, librarians, and counselors who have reached the age of 55 and have decided to retire, but have not yet done so, are eligible to apply for ferp. the program is not available to coaching faculty unit employees.a faculty member must decide whether to ferp before retiring. if a faculty member retires without indicating the desire to ferp, the privilege is lost.we encourage a prospective retiree to consult with his/her chair/director, library dean, or counseling services director as early as possible. the ferp application must be completed no later than the last day in february. the completed application should be submitted to the department chair/director. it will be routed to the college dean, and faulty services for approval.in addition to working with the faculty services, the faculty member must also notify their department chair, their benefits representative in university personnel, and a calpers representative. university personnel may be reached at 408-924-2250 and calpers may be reached at 1-888-225-7377.following are two important calpers publications that may be helpful to you, "retirement planning checklist", & "employment after retirement.another office you may contact is the social security administration to discuss medicare and other benefits. you may reach them at 1-800-772-1213.a faculty member can only commence ferp after having been retired. a faculty member can only apply to ferp before retiring.participation in ferp must start at the beginning of an academic year. faculty usually apply for ferp in the month of february before retirement.examples:no. there is a strict limit set by calpers on total employment during ferp. according to technical letter hr/ben 2004-08 and pursuant to calpers regulations (gc 21227), "a retired person may serve without reinstatement from retirement or loss or interruption of benefits provided by this system [calpers] as a member of the academic staff of a california state university, if that service does not exceed, in any fiscal year, a total of 960 hours for all employers or 50 percent of the hours the member was employed during the last fiscal year of service prior to retirement." during the period of ferp participation, both the agreement provisions and the calpers regulations applyaccording to hr/benefits 2004-08, "csu employment in summer/special session/extension is not available to participants who are employed at 50% for the academic year (or the corresponding limit for librarians or counselors), since they already have reached the allowable employment limit." csu employees may, consistent with campus policies governing outside activities, be employed outside the csu system. however, conflicts of interest are not permitted.leave of absence without pay in the fiscal year prior to retirement affects how much ferp faculty may work during ferp.example:past practice at san jos state university is to allow an appointment that is mutually agreeable to the faculty member and his/her chair and dean. changes in the initially approved appointment (e.g. 50% over 2 semesters or 1.00 in one semester) must be recommended by the chair and the dean and approved by university personnel-faulty services.if it is not possible to reach mutual agreement about the change of appointment that is deemed by the president to be pragmatically necessary, the president may alter the schedule upon notice to the faculty member in ferp one hundred twenty (120) days in advance.note: this means that no change in appointment which means no change in the number of units to be taught, in the semesters during which teaching is to take place, can be imposed upon the faculty member in ferp without 120 days' notice. the term appointment as it is used here does not refer to the issue of which courses are to be taught or at what time of day or day of the week they are to be taught. it only refers to the number of units per semester. work assignments as to courses and times within a semester, and as to assignments to advising and committee work within a semester, remain the prerogative of the administration, delegated to the "appropriate administrator," usually the dean, although the usual consultative procedures are to be followed.according to the current csu-cfa agreement, courses are assigned in the following priority order:the simple answer is, yes but only after all other possibilities are explored and exhausted, only in accord with detailed procedures described below, and only as the last available option.if, for programmatic or budgetary reasons, the department to which the faculty member in ferp belongs will not offer a sufficient selection of classes during an academic year in the areas of expertise of the faculty member in ferp to employ the faculty member to the extent to which s/he is otherwise entitled, we would have to consider the possibility of a layoff of the faculty member in ferp.if layoffs become necessary, article 38 of the current csu-cfa agreement would prevail, and article 38.11 determines the order of layoff namely a faculty member in ferp could not be laid off if there were part-time or full-time temporary faculty in the department scheduled to teach courses for which the faculty member in ferp was qualified. but, according to the same article, faculty members in ferp do not have a priority over full-time tenured or probationary faculty.there are special circumstances when there may be exceptions to the "order of layoff" and these are described in detail in article 38.20 of the currentcsu-cfa agreement. in brief, the exceptions could result from a faculty member having an academic/professional specialization that is needed and non-interchangeable.while the "unit of layoff" is the academic department (or its equivalent), and while being in the ferp program is a departmental-specific appointment, at san jos state university, efforts would be made to explore whether teaching in another department/division/program might be substituted for work in the home department.however, it must be understood that this is not entitlement, but rather something that must be mutually acceptable to the faculty member in ferp, to all department/program chairs/directors, deans involved, and to university personnel-faulty services.in any event, it should be understood that layoffs would be the last option chosen and that, ultimately, all layoffs must be approved by the president.in addition, as with any faculty member, a faculty member in ferp may be terminated for cause or for failure to meet the employment commitment.no. some faculty retire under calpers and enter the ferp program, but choose to delay receiving their social security until they are older to avoid reductions in those payments. in that case, they might wish to have social security contributions continue from their ferp salary, but that is not possible. under the agreement between the state of california and the federal government, once a faculty member retires under calpers, the state may not withdraw social security from your check and it will not make contributions on your behalf.can someone be hired as a part-time lecturer and also receive the ferp salary? - no. someone who has retired under calpers cannot for any reason work more than half-time (for the state of california) without jeopardizing his/her retirement status. also, "half-time" is defined on the basis of half of the final year of appointment (up to the maximum of a full-time academic year load of 30 units) during the last full year before s/he retired.yes, but they start out at the bottom of the order of assignment and have no preference for work over incumbent lecturers. the 180 day clock starts running as of the date of retirement, so people who have completed ferp do not have to then sit out an additional 180 days before coming back as a retired annuitant lecturer.such faculty can commence teaching as a part-time lecturer up to the maximum of half-time (50% of the regular time base in the last full year proceeding retirement), as described above. therefore, a faculty member who had been full-time, and then 50% in the ferp program could, at the conclusion of the ferp appointment, work as a part-time lecturer at no more than 50%.however, the faculty member who was formerly in the ferp program would be in a new category in the order of work, and that is the last category (see answer forwhat priority do i have for course assignments?above). so, as a part-time lecturer a new salary would be based on an agreement between the faculty member and his/her department/school. s/he does not automatically resume at the salary rate and rank at which s/he was previously paid. also, part-time faculty are not compensated for committee work. if a part-time faculty member teaches a 3-unit course, such a period of part-time employment would be the same as that of any temporary faculty unit employee, rather than the entitlement afforded to faculty members in ferp.a request for a leave of absence without pay will be considered only for reasons of personal illness (that is, the ferp participant's illness) and may extend up to a maximum of one full year within any one fiscal or academic year of ferp eligibility. under the currentcsu-cfa agreement, a ferp participant is entitled to a single such leave during the entire period of ferp eligibility (note that article 22 does not apply to ferp participants). any leave time taken, regardless of type or duration, will not extend the total period of ferp eligibility.for example, if a ferp faculty member takes a one year leave without pay, that faculty member would then actively participate in ferp for only the total number of years minus one. the year of leave may not be added to the end of the ferp period to extend the period of eligibility.the university is committed to complying with both the federal family & medical leave act (fmla) and with the california family rights act (cfra) and does so under the terms of the revised csu family medical leaves (fml) policy (technical letter hr 2014 02 [pdf], dated 9-15-14). under the terms of this csu policy, ferp faculty, like all other faculty, are eligible for fml for any one of the following reasons:for numbers 1-4 above, the maximum leave without pay during any year under the fml policy is 12 weeks in a rolling 12-month period beginning with the date that fml commences. for number 5 above, the maximum leave without pay during any year under the fml policy is 26 weeks in a rolling 12-month period beginning with the date that fml commences.ferp participants are also entitled to both carry-overs up to 48 hours of sick leave into their ferp period and to accumulate new sick leave while in ferp.the combined effect of these two leave policies is that:the benefits available to faculty members in ferp if eligible are:there is aprtb/ferp
