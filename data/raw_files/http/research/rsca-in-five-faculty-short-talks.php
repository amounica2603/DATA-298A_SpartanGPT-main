rsca in five: faculty short talks foster a spirit of cross-campus collaboration among sjsu faculty. we invite faculty to present in five minutes with five slides that directly address the featured topic as well as assumptions and/or limitations with methods of determining knowledge about the topic.semiconductors and quantum technologies - march 3, 2023, 10:30 a.m to 1 p.m, mlk room 225, king librarydesign and fabrication of semiconductors and semiconductor devices enable the systems and products we use to work, travel, communicate and entertain, harness energy, treat illness, and make new scientific discoveries. global demand for semiconductors is at an all-time high, but global chip shortages have impacted a range of industries. quantum technologies and quantum computing, which harness the physics of sub-atomic particles, may be able to solve supply chain planning problems, aid in super-secure communications, and provide a new generation of sensors for use in gps systems, communications, and more. we invite talks that address any semiconductor production and supply, quantum technologies and their implications for our economy, and the development of a diverse science and engineering workforce.rsvp to attend or present at semiconductors and quantum technologieshuman factors/human tech interaction - april 28, 2023, 10:30 a.m to 1 p.m, student union, meeting room 3certain aspects of being human, e.g. human factors influence how we interact with everything in our lives and must be taken into account in designs and development of human-technology interactions. approaches from psychology, computer science, engineering, mathematics, medicine, industrial design, kinesiology, and nursing are often used in the study of human factors. here we invite rsca talks that are interdisciplinary or from any angle that investigates human interactions with technology and systems used by humans.rsvp to attend or present at human factors/human tech interactionpast rsca in 5 events
