collaborative studies are those in which each of the institutions involved are significantly engaged in the research, usually by means of local investigators carrying out research activities at each study site.if the study does not entail employees of external institutions collecting data from participants, obtaining informed consent, or being involved as members of the research team, then the work is probably not a collaborative study. likewise, if study personnel will be asking employees at other institutions to pass along recruitment information to prospective participants this, alone, does not constitute a collaborative study.for collaborations that involve both sjsu investigators and external investigators, different approaches may be used to obtain approval depending on how the research will be conducted. either each investigator can independently obtain approval from their respective irbs or one institution can agree to be the reviewing irb.the sjsu irb accepts irb approvals from outside institutions that have an active federalwide assurance (fwa). as an sjsu investigator, your name and role must be outlined in the irb application of the reviewing institution in order for it to be accepted. if the external irb is not willing to approve a protocol until a reliance agreement is established, the sjsu investigator is responsible for submitting all documents noted below except for the approval notification.sjsu investigator external irb approval registration form [docx]register external irb approvals by emailing the above form, along with the documents outlined below toirb@sjsu.edu.you will need to provide the following information and documents in order to complete the submission:the sjsu irb office will contact the reviewing irb to establish a reliance agreement once we receive your submission. you will receive an email that you may begin the study only after a reliance agreement is established. the timeframe for the confirmation will depend on whether the external irb is willing to serve as the irb of record and how quickly they can provide the signed agreement. we recommend that you contact the reviewing irb ahead of time to confirm their cooperation and to determine a timeline for the signing of the reliance agreement. if we are unable to establish a reliance agreement, the sjsu irb will conduct its own review and you will be asked to submit ansjsu irb application.sjsu investigators may list external personnel in their applications. however, the sjsu irb does not assume responsibility for the compliance of external personnel. instead external personnel should contact their irb, either to coordinate a reliance agreement with the sjsu irb as the irb of record or to have their irb conduct a separate review for their activities. external personnel who do not have the support of an external irb and have not established a contract with sjsu should not receive access to individually identifying information about subjects. sjsu investigators are encouraged to be judicious about who they add as part of the study personnel, as responsibility for compliance rests with the sjsu pi in the event that external personal do not have the support of an outside irb.non-sjsu investigators who wish to conduct human subjects research at san jose state university should first seek irb approval from their home institution.once irb approval is obtained from your home institution, follow the steps outlined below for registration:sjsu policy does not require its irb to review research projects by external investigators who either come from an institution lacking an irb or who are conducting research independent of any institutional support. sjsu will not take responsibility for or provide institutional support for external investigators research activities.
