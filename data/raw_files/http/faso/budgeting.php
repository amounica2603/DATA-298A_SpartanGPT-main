budgeting is the absolute best way to get a complete picture of your finances. budgets are great for saving for large purchases, reducing spending in problem areas, and knowing what you can afford. the main goal of your budget should be to live within your means. simply put, you want to earn more money than you spend.start by recording everything you spend money on for a month. once the month is complete, you will be able to see where your money is being spent and be able to make more informed decisions to reduce spending and plan for the future.if you are spending more than you are making, it is time to identify problem spending areas and where to save money. if you are earning more, then maybe its time to start a savings account to have a safeguard for unexpected expenses.you can find a wide variety of budgeting apps and resources online, in google docs, or in your app store. you can even go "old school" and keep track of your expenses with a piece of paper!email:fao@sjsu.edu_________________________phone:408-283-7500 ext 4monday to friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m._________________________live chattuesday to friday 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.__________________________virtual appointmentsfriday from 10:00 a.m - 3:00 p.m._________________________in-person appointmentsmonday to thursday 8:15 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.__________________________student services center (ssc)9street & san fernando(on 1floor of north parking garage)financial aid and scholarship officesan jos state universityone washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0036
