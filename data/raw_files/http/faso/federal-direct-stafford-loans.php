the u.s. department of education offers eligible students at participating schools direct subsidized loans and direct unsubsidized loans to help cover the cost of higher education. some people refer to these loans as stafford loans or direct stafford loans. direct subsidized loans have slightly better terms to help out students with financial need.federal direct subsidized loans are offered to undergraduate and credential students based on demonstrated financial need.the interest on the loan is paid by the department of education as long as the student maintains half-time enrollment (6 units); or during the 6 monthsgrace period*, or if the student has not exceeded his or hermaximum time frame**.*grace period:students who received a direct subsidized loan that was first disbursed between july 1, 2012, and july 1, 2014, are responsible for paying interest that accrues during the grace period. if you choose not to pay the interest that accrues during your grace period, the interest will be added to yourprincipalbalance.**maximum time frame:if you are a first-time borrower on or after july 1, 2013, there is a limit on the maximum period of time (measured in academic years) that you can receive direct subsidized loans.this limit does not apply to direct unsubsidized loans or direct plus loans.if this limit applies, you may not receive direct subsidized loans for more than 150 percent of the published length of your program. this is called your "maximum eligibility period." your maximum eligibility period is based on the published length of your current program. you can find the published length of your program in the school catalog.federal direct unsubsidized loans are offered to all eligible undergraduate and graduate students, even those not demonstrating financial need. the direct unsubsidized loan should be borrowed cautiously, since the borrower will be responsible for paying all the interest on the loan.interest will begin accruing after the first disbursement, even though payment is not required until six months after graduating or dropping below half-time status. interest-only payments may be made while in school, but it is not required.if interest is not paid while in school, the interest is capitalized (added to the original loan amount) once repayment begins.2020-21 deadlines to accept loans:email:fao@sjsu.edu_________________________phone:408-283-7500 ext 4monday to friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m._________________________live chattuesday to friday 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.__________________________virtual appointmentsfriday from 10:00 a.m - 3:00 p.m._________________________in-person appointmentsmonday to thursday 8:15 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.__________________________student services center (ssc)9street & san fernando(on 1floor of north parking garage)financial aid and scholarship officesan jos state universityone washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0036
