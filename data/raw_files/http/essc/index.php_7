generally, meet with an essc advisor to have your ge courses andtransfer credit summaryaudited. they can clear any errors (credits that did not transfer when they should have, for example) that the automated system in the evaluation's office didn't catch., there is an important change in the college of engineering tep process. please read the details below markedgenerally, all information can be found inassist.org.additionally, sjsu has its ownarticulationpage which includes options to view onlyge coursesor major courses (course-to-course list).as soon as possible.if the transfer course is a prerequisite, you will need it posted in your records before you can register for the proceeding course during advanced enrollment. otherwise, you will need to bring unofficial transcripts to the department or instructor in recordto get an add code.failing to show proof or prerequisites may result in being dropped from the course.these are your options:talk to your major advisor for a substitution or a waiver.depending on the course, you might need to submit atransfer equivalencyorintensive sciencepetition.if you're unsure,make an appointmentwith an essc advisor for their recommendations.go to sjsu's catalog listing of ap credit by examination:2022-2023 academic year;2021-2022 academic year;2020-2021 academic year.you will need to send yourofficial scores from college boardto sjsu to apply these credits to your account.the temporary area c waiver for 2021-2022 has been approved for our college.. during the process of transfer credit being posted and evaluated and continuous enrollment verified, evaluations will change your ge catalog year (different from the major catalog year) to fall 2020, which would keep you on the old ge pattern and not require you to take area f.transfer credit will continue to be evaluated and posted throughout the summer, so once credit has been evaluated, please refer to eval@sjsu.edu if you have the continuous enrollment but are being held to area f.read thecsu policy on ge requirements.a(transfer equivalency petition) is strictly for an external course with no articulation agreement already. it is submitted by the student through the tep process, managed by the essc (see below for an important change in the process), and sent to the appropriate department.is when an advisor approves the use of one course (external credit or another sjsu course) for another sjsu course. there could be an articulation agreement, or it could be another sjsu course. only themajor advisorcan make a substitution. this is the more flexible option.here are some examples of substitutions:the student took an external course with no articulation agreement, but the course is very close to an sjsu required course (e.g. cis 22a from de anza for cs 46a).the student took an sjsu course from a different major, and it is close enough to the current major requirement (e.g. ae 30 for me 30).the student submitted a tep (transfer equivalency petition) which was rejected for some reason or another, and the major advisor determines that the course satisfies the major requirement (e.g. a physics course from an international university for phys 50).when in doubt,meet with your major advisorfirst.essc no longer processes teps for college of science courses used to meet engineering or aviation major prep requirements. please read the new! faq question below regarding college of science courses.in general we advise checking in with your major advisor to determine whether a tep is best or necessary. we also advise not signing up for courses you think you have a good chance of receiving credit for using transfer credit (especially as a new transfer student).when in doubt,meet with your major advisorfirst.the cmpe/se department will no longer consider petitions from students trying to substitute a lower-division course for an upper-division sjsu course. pleasecontact the cmpe/se departmentif you have questions., coe transfer equivalency petition (tep) will be used only for:include: aerospace engineering (), aviation (), biomedical engineering (), chemical engineering (), civil engineering (), computer engineering (including software engineering), electrical engineering (), engineering technology (), industrial & systems engineering (), interdisciplinary engineering (), materials engineering (), and mechanical engineering ().the sjsu course needs to have a letter prefix listedabove.: engr 10, ee 98, ce 99, mate 25, tech 60, me 101, ae 20, bme 25, avia 1, ise 130, cmpe 30, me 20, ce 95engineering or aviation students who want to request equivalency for a college of science course will use a different request, through the college of science advising center.
