use a u-lock and lock your bike to a bike rack to keep it safe. a smaller lock is better because it gives thieves less room for a leverage-based attack. it is also helpful to have more than one locking method to prevent theft.at a minimum, you should lock your bike wheel and frame to the bike rack to prevent theft. consider locking your front wheel and taking your seat with you for more security.a bicycle with bolted seats and wheels is better than the quick-release variants as it adds an additional layer of security, discouraging would-be thieves. please do not leave your bike outside without a lock, as it will most likely be stolen quickly.phone:408-924-6242fax:408-924-6224
