graduate writing is different from undergraduate writing, and writing is a communication skill that you need to master regardless of your major. do you know all the parts of a graduate research paper? how to write an abstract or literature review? how to find articles based on your research question? how to seamlessly integrate sources into your writing? the writing center is here to help! we have partnered with the college of graduate studies to help you gain the resources and skills you need to improve your writing skills as you enter into advanced study of your field/discipline. the foundations of graduate writing series includes eight carefully selected workshops to help you increase your confidence and comfort with writing at the graduate level. find out more by reading the descriptions of our eight workshop topics. though attendees will receive the most benefit from attending all the workshop sessions as a cohesive whole, you are welcome to register for whichever dates you can attend. all sessions are conducted online via zoom. registration is required to attend. spots fill quickly, so sign up soon! https://sjsu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tzatdo6sqtgugterzhsffhh_ku6t6y1tutcp contact the writing center director, michelle hager (michelle.hager@sjsu.edu).
