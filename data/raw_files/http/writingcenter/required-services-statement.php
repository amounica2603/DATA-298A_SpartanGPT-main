we greatly appreciate the support of professors across campus in promoting the writing center to their students.however, we have limited resources and, unfortunately, we cannot supportuse of our services. we also request that you do not incentivize your students to use our services (e.g., in the form of students earning points or extra credit for receiving tutoring services.) our reasoning for this policy is outlined below.while we request that professors do not require students to use our services, all professors are more than welcome to encourage their students to visit the writing center, and we are happy to provide house calls to talk about the writing center to any class.we greatly appreciate your cooperation in this matter. if you have any questions, feel free tocontact us. also feel free to reach out to our director, michelle hager (michelle.hager@sjsu.edu), if you'd like to discuss requiring or incentivizing writing center visits for your students.
