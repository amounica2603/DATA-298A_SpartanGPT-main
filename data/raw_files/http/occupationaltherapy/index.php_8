the occupational therapy department has initiated an international experience requirement for students entering the masters degree program in occupational therapy. the overall goal for the international experience is to gain cross-cultural and cross-national insight into the political, social, cultural and economic factors that influence the provision of occupational therapy services outside of the u.s. and define the role of occupational therapy within the system of care. social and occupational justice issues are explored, and the role of the student as a global citizen is emphasized.several types of international experiences are available, including faculty-led study abroad programs and service trips that can be completed during winter or summer sessions. many of the experiences include opportunities to engage with local people in the provision of occupational therapy services. most of the experiences are interdisciplinary, allowing students to work and study with students and providers from a variety of healthcare professions. time abroad typically ranges from one to three weeks with assignments completed prior to the trip and after returning. students register for 1-6 units of coursework for the international experience. the summer 2023 schedule includesinternational experience in finland,vietnamandtaiwan.finland:start: may 28, 2023end: june 9, 2023vietnam:start: june 7, 2023end: june 21, 2023taiwan ():start: june 14, 2023end: june 28, 2023phone:408-924-3070fax:408-924-3088email:occupationaltherapyadminadmissions information::gradadvisor-occupationaltherapy@sjsu.edu:otdadvisor-occupationaltherapy@sjsu.eduoffice hours:monday -thursdayfriday
