an experience of a lifetime meeting new people and learning about the finnish culture.it was great to have the opportunity to discuss healthcare similarities and differences among several cultures. it was also fun to make new friends and connections.the energy of the students and faculty was the of the learning experience.i wanted to acquire a new cultural lens that i could use in my future role as a student and as a practitioner. in the bay area, the population that ots will encounter is incredibly diverse.the experience is priceless and an opportunity that might not come up again in your lifetime, especially while you have the support of a professor and fellow students.i didnt know any of the people when i went..now, i have 15 new friends within a different health field that i still keep in touch with.read the "" blog.i appreciated the surprises that came with being exposed to a different culture - like the boat full of plants for sale on a floating market.what made the trip great was getting to know the awesome people on it.the main form of transportation in vietnam is the motorbike. strange fact: helmets are required for adults only!all program fees are for a 3-unit course andthe cost of airfare & personal expenses including some meals.phone:408-924-3070fax:408-924-3088email:occupationaltherapyadminadmissions information::gradadvisor-occupationaltherapy@sjsu.edu:otdadvisor-occupationaltherapy@sjsu.eduoffice hours:monday -thursdayfriday
