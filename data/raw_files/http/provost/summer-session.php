to: academic affairs divisionfrom: vincent j. del casino, jr., provost and senior vp of academic affairsdear colleagues,i hope this email finds you all healthy and well! as we go into spring break 2020 next week, i just want to remind you that when we return from that break, all classes will remain online. this is a standard now set across the entire california state university.also, given the current projected spread of covid-19 and the measures needed to mitigate its spread, i want to announce that all courses offered in the summer session 2020 term will be online.fortunately, nearly 40% of our summer offerings are already online. of course, that means nearly 60% of courses have to be either canceled or converted to a remote or online modality.with summer session 2020 registration for courses just around the corner, we need everyones helpfaculty, department chairs and directors, and staffto make our three sessions a robust opportunity for students to continue to make progress towards their degrees. without summer courses, some students will take even longer to finish their academic plans.the college of professional and global education, whichadministers summer session, will be sending an email to all chairs and associate deans with procedures for transitioning courses to an online format. these messages will include information about support services available to faculty fromsjsu ecampusand thecenter for faculty development.should the covid-19 situation ease, allowing face-to-face instruction later in the summer, it is possible to add traditional campus-based courses for the final five-week session. as final decisions are made, an update will be communicated.time is short. advance registration for summer session 2020 starts. students can add courses up to may 27, but the sooner we post the courses, the better for all concerned.as a reminder, please visit sjsuhealth advisories websitefor current information, advisories, faqs, and resources available to our campus community.thank you for your help, as always.all the best,vinphone:408-924-2400email:provost@sjsu.educlark hall 552one washington squaresan jos, ca 95192-0020
