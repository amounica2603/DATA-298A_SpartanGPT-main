creative artscollege of humanities and the artsi did not choose creative arts, i feel like creative arts chose me. the nature of the program appealed to me because it focuses not only on the importance of creativity but also the collaboration of ideas and social activism through artistic mediums that promote change for the betterment of society as a whole. i have been a music teacher and advocate for children and the lgbtq community throughout my adult life, so it seemed only natural for my life path to lead me here in order to give me a more well rounded understanding of the world and how important the arts are to the preservation of diversity and culture. i truly feel like i found my place in the creative arts major. with that said, i could not be more proud to accept this academic award.for me, this honor is a symbol of my curiosity and thirst for knowledge. school had never come easy to me, mostly because i feel that i was not properly prepared for higher education as i was placed on a vocational track at a young age due to certain learning disabilities. regardless of that carried stigma, i realized that if you follow your heart and immerse yourself in subjects that you are passionate about, the education you receive will be fulfilling and provide you with endless opportunities.there are countless people who have encouraged me throughout this journey and i am extremely fortunate to have a family who supports me and encourages me to follow my dreams. on top of that, my creative arts classmates and professors have also become like a family to me and i think that that is what makes the program so special. there is so much love, support and mutual respect within this diverse group of people that it inspires each of us to want to succeed and work hard for one another as well as ourselves. additionally, there is no one student or professor that could be viewed as better or more successful than the next because each persons contribution is vital in breathing life into the program as an educational experience. however, there is one person that i would personally like to acknowledge as the glue that holds us together and that person is dr. shannon rose riley. dr. riley has had such a profound effect on my progress as a student and my personal growth as a human. i cannot thank her enough for the knowledge, compassion and guidance that she has shown me throughout my time at sjsu. cheers to you, dr. riley! you are unforgettable and without a doubt, one of a kind.i am a spartan because i am part of a team of amazing individuals who have shown tenacity, perseverance and strength. congratulations to the creative arts graduating class of spring 2017. we did it!professor, humanities departmenttalia rizzi was identified as an at risk youth in california public education and had a long struggle through grade school as a girl who chose, from the age of 5, to dress as a boy. in fall 2015, talia transferred to sjsu from west valley collegeand since that time has become an integral part of the creative arts major as well as the humanities student club (currently serving as treasurer). talia is an excellent student who is stepping into her leadership potential. for example, she has recently created the stand up coalition, which is an arts-based anti-hate coalition that already has multi-campus participation! she has worked with faculty, students, and administrators at west valley and sac city college, both of which launched stand up coalition during their flex day eventsand san jos state also has an active chapter. she has recently reached out to local assemblymen around trans-gender issues and is working to build a community to help nurture and protect lgbtq rights as well as at risk youth. for me, this is why we do what we doto watch a student who was so terribly mislabeled find her strength and her voice to act as an agent for change.phone:408-924-2400email:provost@sjsu.educlark hall 552one washington squaresan jos, ca 95192-0020
