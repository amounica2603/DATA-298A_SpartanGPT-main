sent: april 13, 2021from: vincent j. del casino, jr., provost and senior vice president for academic affairsdear colleagues,as we start to move through the second half of this spring term i have to pause and thank everyone for the unbelievable work over the past more-than 12 months of pandemic life. as we move into the next six to nine months, i have to continue to ask that everyone remain patient because it will remain hard to pin down exactly what will be happening in the fall. that said, we have to plan and plan we will. we are making adjustments as we speak as new directives come to light and as new data are shared about the pandemic. there is no doubt that whatever happens, fall will be a transition semester!as we plan on our return to campus, i want to make sure everyone knows that we have plenty of ppe and cleaning supplies. there is no need to rush and order supplies when you return to your office. you can request what you needhere. you can always find updated information on thesjsu adapt website.we will be hosting drop in sessions where cabinet members, campus leaders, and members of the repopulation working group can hear your concerns and ideas about safely and effectively repopulating our campus. there will be several drop in sessions scheduled for students, staff, faculty, and administrators.a reminder: to help our students as we transition back to campus, dont forget that we will still be available virtually so let them know your virtual hours and open office hours by posting signs, changing your voicemail on your office phones, and announcing it on your website. make sure to share the information with your faculty too!i want to take this opportunity to send some well deserved kudos to our 80 custodians that have worked so hard to keep our campus clean and safe! most of the cleaning is done during the graveyard shift from 10:30pm to 7am. a few volunteered to move to the day shift to accommodate day time sanitizing efforts. they have deployed clorox 360 electromagnetic misting units to sanitize spaces in minutes with this awesome clorox 360 unit! if you are interested, you can find more information on how it workshere. during shelter in place, this dedicated crew kept working to keep the spaces clean and sanitized and for this, i wanted to tell them, thank you for your commitment to sjsu!i am looking forward to seeing you all on campus soon!cheers!vinphone:408-924-2400email:provost@sjsu.educlark hall 552one washington squaresan jos, ca 95192-0020
