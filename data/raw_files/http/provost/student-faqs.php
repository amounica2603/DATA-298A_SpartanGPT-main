to: studentsfrom: vincent j. del casino, jr., provost and senior vp for academic affairsto all students,as you all know, we made the decision this week to suspend in-person classes at sjsu to give our faculty and staff time to move to more remote instructional approaches. this obviously raises a lot of questions. what you find below, is a list of what we believe have been the most frequently asked questions from students about this transition.we are working incredibly hard to make these changes to our learning environment as smooth as possible. please let us know if you have questions that go beyond the list compiled below (emailprovost@sjsu.edu). we will update the list and post it online so that students can refer to it over the next several weeks (go tosjsu health advisories websitefor updates).as the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, i want you to know that the entire sjsu faculty and staff community is committed to the safety and well-being of every student, while maintaining the quality of each students education to the best of our ability.stay safe in this time of dynamic change.sincerely,vincent j. del casino jr., ph.d.provost and senior vice president for academic affairsprofessor, urban and regional planningupdated: march 12, 2020classes may be taught remotely in many different ways. for example, some classes may keep meeting at the same time as they do now but use technology (such as zoom) to deliver lecture material. this is called synchronous instruction. in other cases, the class may move toward self-paced work that does not require meeting at a specific time (this is called asynchronous instruction). faculty members will be communicating with students about the requirements of each individual class.some classes do not translate well into remote modes of instruction. this is particularly true for courses such as labs, practicums, or studio-based courses. in each case, if you are going to meet on campus for a course, the faculty members will be helping you practice appropriate respiratory hygiene etiquette, as required by the santa clara county department of public health.this will include practicing social distancing. if you are unable to attend these in-person courses, please contact your instructor as soon as possible to make accommodations.yes, it is possible that some classes may have on campus exams. if that is the case, the instructor will notify you quickly. in the event that an exam will occur on campus, the instructor will take all social distancing precautions, including seating students at least six feet apart. if you cannot attend an exam that is being delivered in a in-person format, please contact your instructor to make accommodations.the university remains open even though classes are happening remotely. if you have a laptop, you will still be able to come to campus during the day and work from the student union or dr. martin luther king jr. (mlk) library.departments and colleges with computer lab spaces will make laptops available for student use. additionally, the mlk library is setting up some classrooms with computers for student use. in each case, we will be following appropriate social distancing guidelines.the mlk library has computers that can be loaned to students on a first-come, first-serve basis. the campus is looking to augment its computer stock. in addition, please note that the campus is making as many computers as possible available during current working hours.our peer connections continue to operate and are ready to provide support to help you navigate our remote learning tools. you are encouraged to reach out to your instructors, teaching assistants, or embedded peer educators directly with questions about how to successfully navigate the online learning experiences in their classes.additionally, theecampus officecan also help answer technical questions for students about navigating canvas, zoom, google chat, or other new technologies associated with their classes (408-924-2337).to be successful remote learners, students must practice a bit more self-discipline and initiative. without your classmates or instructor physically present, you might feel disengaged during a lecture. also, courses using tools for remote learning may challenge you to work with your classmates in virtual break out rooms or other online spaces.with that in mind, it is important to log-in to courses often, track requirements, and set calendar reminders. because your instructors have changed to remote instruction in the middle of the semester, you should pay particular attention to any changes to the course syllabus and requirements. you may also find it helpful to complete any online coursework during the times you have typically set aside for your homework.remember, while you can learn from anywhere, courses taught via online or remote instruction arent easier than their face-to-face versions.please continue to attend any off-site course-related experiences as long as the host site is continuing to operate. if there is a change in policy at the off-site location, please contact your department immediately.yes, the aec will continue to be open.please check with them in advance for appointments or questions.peer connections will continue to offer in-person and virtual tutoring on campus.
