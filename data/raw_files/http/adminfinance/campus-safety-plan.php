san jose state university (sjsu) is an urban campus located on 154 acres in the heart of california's third (and americas tenth) largest city. from its beginning in 1857 as a teacher's college, sjsu has grown into a thriving community of more than 33,000 faculty, students and staff.as sjsu grew, so did the city of san jose. once an agricultural community of a few thousand homes; san jos is now the tenth largest city in united states with a population of more than one million people.as a city within a city, the university is committed to safeguarding members of the campus community as well as the large and growing number of visitors who come to the campus year-round to take advantage of its curricular, cultural, entertainment and artistic programming. this overview is intended to provide a general holistic sense of the infrastructure, staffing and related programs that contribute to the campuss overall safety efforts.the unversity police department (upd) annually documents about 60,000 incidents, arrests between 800 and 900 suspects and writes about 2,500 reports. the police communications center dispatches upd personnel to more than 50,000 calls for service each year. upd andparking servicespersonnel annually work more than 200 special events attended by over 500,000 people. sjsus upd is also dispatch for foothill/deanza college, and california maritime academy.sjsu began employing sworn armed police officers in the 1970's. on october 1, 1975, upd police officers became armed 24 hours a day by executive order of the csu/chancellor's office. upd officers were recognized by the california commission on police officers standards and training (p.o.s.t.) in 1975 and in the years since then the upd has developed into a full-service law enforcement agency.408-924-2222408-924-2226408-924-2185408-277-3512408-337-2919sjsu@tipnow.org408-924-223632 authorized sworn officers;

and public library users. this convergence brings both unique opportunities for collaboration and uncommon security challenges. over time, the university and city have adapted to emerging behavior patterns and trends. this report summarizes efforts to optimize the safety of library patrons from all use groups while maintaining a philosophical commitment to accessibility for all library patrons.authorized strength for library security is two sworn police officers and 15 library security officers (a combination of fte and pte positions), scheduled to provide coverage during the hours that the library is open to students and the general public. currently, the police officer positions are staffed and there are two library security officer (lso) vacancies in the process of being filled. over the last year, safety concerns necessitated hiring security officers from a private vendor to staff fixed post positions on the 6, 7and 8floors. this additional coverage will continue until lso staffing is up to authorized strength.suspension policyin order to address egregious violations and patrons who consistently cause problems and violate library policy, library administration has created a comprehensive suspension policy with proscribed penalties for particular violations including graduated penalties for repeat offenders. these suspensions are in addition to any penalties meted out through the criminal justice system.this suspension process is initiated when the library security lead officer submits a request along with supporting documentation to the city librarys senior public safety officer. library administrators review the request and notify the library security lead officer of approval and length of suspension. after receiving the notice of approval, the lead library security officer ensures that the suspension paperwork is served to the offending patron. the patron then has a right to an appeal before a city library administrator who acts as an arbitrator. after an appeal, the city librarys senior public safety officer notifies the lead library security officer of the arbitrators decision.over the past 2 years, there have been approximately 600 arrests/citations at the library, which any time an individual is detained or issued a citation. fewer than 20 of these incidents have involved sjsu affiliates (sjsu faculty, staff, students or auxiliary employees).the 2016 task force comprised representatives from academic affairs; the university police department; facilities, development and operations; student affairs and the city of san jose, under the joint direction ofpast universitylibrarydean ruth kifer (retired may 2016) and san jose publiclibrarydirector jill bourne. university library dean tracy elliott (june 2016) recently met with the presidents cabinet to discuss safety and security issues in thelibrary and review a series of proposed immediate and long-term recommendations. since then, the following actions have been taken:after an incident in a second floor restroom, little-used books from the second floor of thelibrary have been relocated to thelibrary's lower level compact shelving. by the end of may, new lighting will be installed on the second floor and the remaining tall shelving will be removed to allow better visibility of the entire space by staff working at the service desk.a student advisory group is being formed so that students can voice their concerns aboutlibrary safety and make recommendationsto improve thelibraryspaces.vice president of student affairsreggie blaylock is assisting with identifying students to serve on this task force.we want thelibraryto be a safe space for all users.the university will continue to provide updates asthelibrarysafety task force continues with these efforts.classroom locks will be similar to the current exterior ones and will be programmed to remain unlocked, locked, or locked by the occupant. the locks can also be controlled by upd in an active shooter instance or locked by the occupant. we currently have 67 requests for these locks and testing is underway at hammer theater, engineering and clark hall. once we work out the programming we will begin the deployment of the locks.common access card technology (combine tower & id cards). the goal as far as safety is concerned is to add functionality to the towercard which allows it to unlock doors on campus, thus enabling us to lock facilities which once had to be left unlocked, without having to issue keys or carry a second badge.theassociated students,president, chief of police, facilitiesand others conducted ato review conditions on the campus. these walks have led to increased signage, lighting, trimming of greenery, etc. additionally, upd personnel routinely check to assure that exterior lights are functioning,bluelightand elevator phones are in good working order, exterior doors are locked when appropriate, and any observable safety issues are corrected. physical access touniversity housingfacilities is limited at all times to residents, their guests and authorized members of sjsu faculty and staff.the fall 2016 safety walk resulted in 54 items identified as potential safety concerns. five safety concerns were related to the student union perimeter and student union maintenance staff will resolve the concerns. most had to do with a lighting control and timer system. one item belonged to the event center and they are working on the problem. the remaining 48 items will be handled by fd&o. presently, 11 have been completed, 15 are in progress and the remaining 22 items will be completed over the 2017 summer break.this past summer we completed the retrofit of all pathway lights on campus, changing mercury vapor and metal halide lights and ballast to energy efficient led. this change has generated an energy savings along with less stress on the aging underground electrical infrastructure. in addition to the pathway lighting, several buildings, that previously had high energy usage wall pack lighting, have been updated to led wall packs. there are a few remaining lights near campus village 2 that have the older style lamps. those will be changed to the new led lights in summer 2017.the solar photovoltaic canopy above the south parking garage at 7th st (top floor only) is slated for new led lighting (the old lighting will be shaded by the photovoltaic panels when they are installed). the plans are being finalized by strataap, with construction further pending award of the csu-wide solar mea's and a subsequent successful award. only the top floor would be affected.we will begin theremovalof approximately 15 old and very sick pinetreesthat are currently on the north side of the south parking garage. thetreeremoval should take approximately 1 week to complete. they are beingremovedas a part of the infrastructure utilities project associated with the construction of the student recreation and aquatic center., over the years thesetreeshave destroyed a storm line running directly beneath their roots; we are going to replace this storm line as a part of the project.our head groundskeeper has looked at thesetreesand confirmed that they are in fact in poor health, and is in agreement with theirremovalfrom atreemaintenance and health perspective.due to the damage that anytreescould cause to the new storm line, our current plan does not include planting newtreesin the same location. we will need to find another area on campus to replace thetreeswe are taking down.two of the "bricks" (old residential housing) came down in the fall, and we will prepare the full site this summer. we will beremovinga significant number oftrees, shrubs and landscaping from the area. this is completely consistent with the approved plans. please note that for everytree/shrub weremoveanother will be replanted (either in the new landscaping plan or elsewhere on campus).this will be a significant amount of work in july that will enable us to have asafe environmentwhen students return in mid-august.construction fencing has been a safety concern with all long-term major projects. two repeating concerns consist of support legs for fencing becoming a potential trip hazard and fence corners covered with a fabric has created a blind spot. to avoid these concerns in the future, wording has been added to the division 1 construction documents that requires the contractor to drive the fence poles into the ground and not to use support legs. for short term projects orange construction cones need to be placed over the support legs identifying trip hazard. contractors will be directed that corners on all temporary fencing need to be exposed 10 feet in either direction so pedestrians can see through the fence and be able to see around a corner.the san jose state university (sjsu) emergency management program works with the extended sjsu community to coordinate emergency planning, training, response and recovery efforts during and after disruptive incidents and major disasters. a cornerstone of this program is theemergency operation plan [pdf](eop), which is a guide on how to conduct an all-hazard response. it is built on scalable, flexible, and adaptable coordinating structures to align key roles and responsibilities on the campus. the plan describes specific authorities and best practices for managing emergencies ranging from catastrophic natural disasters and active shooter incidents to large scale terrorists attacks. the eop has been written to be compliant with federal and state guidelines, the national incident management system (nims) and the california standardized emergency management system (sems) respectively. in order to become familiar with their responsibilities and acquire the skills necessary to perform the required tasks, emergency personnel must attend training sessions regularly. also, exercises provide a means to validate plans, checklists, and procedures, as well as evaluate the skills of response personnel. the eop facilitates response and short-term recovery activities, streamlining long term recovery. an effective response hinges upon well-trained leaders and responders who have invested in emergency preparedness, developed engaged partnerships on campus, and are able to achieve shared objectives.the san jose state university amateur radio club (sjsuarc) is a resource that can be used to supplement sjsu existing communications systems in case of a large scale disaster. the club is open to students at san jose state university who are interested in ham radio, radio communications, and rf. you do not need a ham license to join. staff and non-students are also invited to join. the purpose of the sjsuarc is to promote amateur radio and encourage students, faculty and staff at san jose state university to use amateur radio. founded in 1929, it is the oldest club at san jose state university.there are a wide variety of video camera systems deployed on campus. in 2013, upd instituted a protocol for the review of requests for video surveillance cameras in an attempt to control the proliferation and ensure uniformity of standards. (these parameters will likely be impacted by the new csu security camera policy in draft format today).12 cameras license plate reader (alpr)15 cameras pedestrian access point10 cameras vehicle access

venues and regulations. other initiatives that will assist in alleviating public safety concerns include:alertsjsu is the campus emergency notification system. in case of a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees on the campus, alertsjsu will be utilized to send text messages, voicemails and emails with a brief description of the situation and instructions if possible. for sjsu students alertsjsu is an opt-out program. for faculty and staff members, it is an opt-in program. the campus recently changed alertsjsu vendors from blackboard connect to rave alert.timely warnings are sent when a clery reportable crime occurs on campus that presents a serious and continuing threat to students and staff. timely warnings are typically sent by email, faxed to offices with instructions to post in a conspicuous location and physically posting flyers in garages and other public locations.as a recognized california state law enforcement agency, upd is required to provide thedepartment of justicewith a monthly report containing the number and type of criminal offenses committed within our jurisdiction, as well as citations issued and arrests made. this information is forwarded to the federal bureau of investigation for inclusion in their annual publication,crime in the united states.thejeanne clery actrequires sjsu to provide additional information to the community. crimes that must be reported include:the clery act requires any sjsu campus official having knowledge of criminal acts (as defined by the clery act) to report that information to upd for inclusion in ourannual safety report.upd asks all campus counselors to encourage their clients, when appropriate, to report criminal violations on a voluntary, confidential basis, for inclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics. any information received in response is included in our annual safety report.crime statistics for thecity of san jos are not included in this publication. the city of san jos is one of the safest large cities in the united states. crime statistics for the san jos police department can be found atsj police official crime statistics.review of body-worn camera videos by the vice president of administration & finance anytime there is:the next business day, a review of the video with upd chief & vp of administration & finance.no footage can be released off campus until it has been reviewed by vp of administration & financeand campus counsel.in the event of a significant event posing an immediate threat to the campus requiring an emergency notification, the most effective means of alerting the greatest number of community members is likely to be an audio alert system.the campus has purchased and built a silent alert system which allows for a silent panic button to appear on all campus desk phones.several critical locations on campus are protected by security alarms and/or silent panic buttons, which report to university police.as mandated by the chancellors office, all university computers are equipped with a link to thecsu red folder, which provides helpful information about response protocol in assisting students, faculty & staff in distress.upd offers safety presentations atnew student orientationeach semester as well as to new employee orientation. these presentations are designed to give new students an overview of the types of crime that can exist on campus, with tips and strategies to avoid becoming a victim. the message is that many of the crimes on the campus are crimes of opportunity; there are basic steps that students can take to protect themselves, such as locking doors in the residence hall or using the escort service provided by upd when walking alone across campus at night. the presentations stress reporting suspicious activity and crime to the police.bike registration is done through upd utilizing the national bike registry (nbr), an internet-based system. there was initially public outreach on nbr, but the response was minimal. bikes are also registered through alternative transportation solutions when community members request access to the bike corrals.supplementing thepolice patrol division, upd also maintains an extensive public safety assistant (psa) program, in addition to a volunteer student police cadet program. psas are pre-screened and undergo a field training program prior to working on their own. psas wear distinctive uniforms, are equipped with police radios and provide the campus community with manyadditional services, such as:through thesafety escort program, psas provide escorts for members of the campus community up to 2blocks off-campus, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. typically, a trained, uniformed psa equipped with a radio willwalk you to your destination. however, in the event that a psa is not available, a police officer will provide theescort.thesjsu safe ride programextends the escort distance beyond the two blocks to interstate 280 to the south, julianstreet to the north, first street to the west and sixteenth street to the east. the safe ride program is availablemonday through friday from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m.if you feel unsafe walking through campus, you can request an escort, or the safe ride program by using any bluelight or elevator phone. you can also dial 4-2000 from any on-campus phone or 408-924-2000 from any outsidephone. you will be connected to a upd dispatcher who will arrange the escort.tipnow is an anonymous suspicious activity reporting system that allows community members to communicate with upd via text messages, email or voice-mail.upd will be working with an outside vendor to re-structure and update the upd website to make it more organized and user-friendly. research has shown that the website is accessed at a much higher rate than initially believed, but feedback has indicated that it is difficult to navigate.the san jose state university police department provides the run, hide, defend training inan effortto better prepare our campus.since an active shooter situation is often over within 10 to 15 minutes, before law enforcement arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared both mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation. san jose state university police, active shooter training website:run, hide, fight. the chancellors office has agreed to fund a system wide active shooter response video that the csu chiefs will be collaborating to produce.a few times each semester, upd offers a 12 unit self-defense class designed specifically for females. although there is a physical segment in which participants practice against an officer in a red man suit, the primary focus is on developing awareness and a safety mindset.[pptx]working together we can have a positive impact on violence in the workplace.osha workplace violence fact sheet (pdf) [pdf]started in the fall of 2016, this group meets quarterly through the year to provide input & feedback from students to upd.blue light phones offer a direct connection to upd dispatch for both emergency and non-emergency requests. if a blue light phone receiver is removed from its cradle and the dispatcher cannot elicit a response from the caller, an officer is dispatched immediately to the location of the phone.bluelight emergency telephones are located all across campus, including in the residence halls and on every floor of the parking garages. they are identified by a blue light and signage. there are several types of bluelight phones around campus. some bluelight phones are activated by just pushing the button and talking. other types of bluelight phones require you to pick up the handset and use it like a regular telephone.all bluelight and elevator phones ring directly into the upd communication center and are answered in the same priority as a 9-1-1 call. the phones require 2 - 3 seconds to connect with the police dispatcher. the location of each bluelight phone is automatically identified when the police dispatcher receives the call. in the event that you cannot speak, just push the button or knock the handset off the hook and upd officers will be dispatched to your location. police dispatchers can hear background noise, so any noise that you can make regarding the emergency is helpful.san jose state university police has just made it easier for our community to look up information about police involved incidents that have recently occurred on or near campus. the community can view this information by going to the linkhttps://csusj.crimegraphics.com/2013/default.aspx. you can also view this information by going to theupd websiteand clicking on bulletins/crime charts/bols found under thesection. we hope you find this new tool helpful. using citizen rims software, the university police department makes crime data available to the public via the internet. the idea is to make as much information as possible available in an easy to use format.this is pin mapping for historical police activity data with the user picking the date span to be
