the csu uses the interagency financial transaction (ift) as its standard mechanism to collect and disburse funds between campuses (including the chancellor's office). instead of invoicing campus b for expenses campus a has incurred on its behalf, campus a simply submits an ift to the chancellor's office. the chancellor's office then notifies the bank used by the csu to move cash from campus b's account to campus a's account. it's recommended that the campus requesting the money completes the ift request. ifts aren't applicable to csu auxiliary organizations check payments are processed, similar to 3rd party payments.ift is formerly known as cash posting order (cpo).phone: 408-924-1558email:financeconnect@sjsu.edufinance and business servicessan jos state university60 south market streetsuite 470san jos, ca 95113
