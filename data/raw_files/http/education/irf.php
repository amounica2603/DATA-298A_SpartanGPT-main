works with dreamers who understand the limitations of schooling. with this foundational tenet, tuc advances the movement for school abolition and enlivens educational pathways that support youth to embrace their sacred purpose and self-determined futures.this year, the uc is working with educators in the san francisco bay area to observe the relationship between teachers health, their classroom practices and their students wellness when selected teachers are immersed in a year-long series of monthly health-based workshops. one way the study measures the efficacy of the health-based educational intervention for teachers is through the study and measurement of telomeres. chronic alterations in the stress response can lead to high and sustained levels of stress hormones (e.g. cortisol) that result in accelerated cellular aging and thus the shortening of telomere length (geronimus et al. 2006). telomeres are the protective caps on chromosomes that guard against cell deterioration. research links the lengthening of telomeres to compassion based practices (hoge et. al, 2013). in addition to telomere measurement, the study will analyze changes in classroom practice, teacher self-perception of wellness as well as youth perception of wellness over the course of one academic year.dr. emerald templeton is an equity-minded scholar-practitioner with expertise in

ethnic studies and hopes to pursue it beyond sjsu by becoming an ethnic studies teacher.as an ethnic studies teacher at a public high school in the oakland unified school district, i constantly find myself negotiating the contradictions of teaching liberating content in a system that requires the use of carceral logics and dehumanizing pedagogies in order to run a classroom. i originally found myself in the classroom because i was interested in how our literacy journeys can shape our identities as well as how learning how to language in specific ways can be consequential to our life trajectories. however, my work mentoring students in the boston public school district, as a masters student in language and literacy education at bu and now as an english/ethnic studies teacher in ousd has continued to bring me back to larger questions about the systems in which we are asked to learn and build relationships with youth. as an irf fellow i hope to be in community with others in which we center relation and care in the work of researching and resisting the experiences created by the systems we live under.sheryll is the daughter of dorothy and the granddaughter of artelia. she

deteriorating state of wellness among our nations youth is a brewing health crisis hidden in plain sight. the narrow focus on academic performance continues to neglect vital aspects of youth

reality of our current state and consequences if unattended, we reveal the opportunities to make meaningful and scalable change that can steer us in a hopeful direction.register for the
