find out more about our bertha kalm scholarship recipients and hear what drives their passion to make a difference.mfa creative writingas a queer writer, ive often been concerned with voices on the margins. going back to school to get my mfa in creative writing was as much about being connected to diverse peer writers and artists as it was about finding my own voice. with my previous experiences in independent podcasting and book publishing, ive seen the potential to shift power and resources towards underrepresented voices and artists. i hope to continue this passion through creating platforms that directly serve artists and community members in a variety of waysalways with accessibility and empowerment in mind. this year, being involved with reed magazine and the cla will allow me to get the leadership experience in community arts programming that i hope to implement on my own after graduation.master of urban planningthe impetus for my passion to make a difference is because someone before me had the courage to make a difference, so i could live a more fruitful life. in particular, these people include my enslaved ancestors, civil right leaders, community activists, community members, and my parents and other family members. making a difference is not always easy, the best way to pay homage to our ancestors is to pay it forward to generations following us.ms occupational therapycounselor educationmy greatest passion for making a difference in the world stems from my educational experience toward higher education. as a first-generation, low-income vietnamese american man, i grew up in a single-parent household where i, as the eldest son, had the sole responsibility of taking care of my family while my mother, a vietnamese immigrant, worked incredibly hard to make ends meet to put food on our table and keep a roof over our heads. although i successfully became the first in my family to graduate from college, my journey toward achieving this goal was not easy due to my low socioeconomic background and not having the navigational assistance to steer me toward higher education. through my own educational journey and my work as a counselor intern at west valley college in eops, i realized that students like me are often challenged with attaining their educational goals due to various circumstances that make it difficult for them to do so. in fact, achieving my educational goals of transferring to a 4-year university and earning a college degree was something that i initially thought was out of reach for someone like me.as a future community college counselor, i am keenly determined to decrease these unequal, recurring rates by closing the achievement gap among first-generation, low-income college students from diverse backgrounds so that they can attain their educational goals. i strive to use my education to provide opportunities for college students from underserved communities to help them achieve their dreams and aspirations through higher education, ultimately fueling my passion and drive to continue making a difference for humanity and in the world entirely.public health and recreationas a graduate student and public health worker, i am guided by my personal experiences as someone who was incarcerated as a young person. i am resourced by those who have paved the way for generations before me, fighting for the rights of black, indigenous, disabled, immigrants, women, trans people, and other oppressed groups. i believe public health as a field has an important role and responsibility to support marginalized communities in our fight for dignity and liberation. specifically, i believe that racial justice is central to public health and envision a world where public health is a leader in addressing structural racism through bold action such as divesting from carceral solutions and investing in community-centric efforts like housing and healthcare for everyone and universal basic income.masters of social work
