for each admission term, a select number of programs will give preference in the impaction process to transfer applicants who have completed program-specific preparatory coursework.sjsu has determined that the completion of program-specific coursework or an associate degree for transfer (adt) as approved in our impaction plan and listed on our supplemental criteria for transfer applicants pages, will support successful completion of these degree programs and timely graduation.the programs that will give preference to applicants who have met supplemental criteria fall into two categories:programs that have identified lower-division preparatory courses as supplemental criteria and will rank students based on a combination of the number of program-specific preparatory courses completed and self-reported gpa.for example, an applicant who has completed one or more of the courses associated with a program listed here, will be given preference over other applicants who have the same gpa, but have not completed any of the supplemental courses. similarly, if two applicants have completed the same number of program-specific preparation courses, preference will be given to the applicant with the higher gpa.programs that have identified an associate degree for transfer as supplemental criteria will give preference to applicants who have completed the major-specific associate degree for transfer (adt). for these programs, an applicant that has completed the adt identified by the sjsu program, will get preference over an applicant with the same gpa that did not earn the identified adt.interested in applying to an undergraduate program or visiting campus, visit ourundergraduate student outreach and recruitment office website.interested in applying to a graduate program or have questions about applying, visit ourgraduate enrollment management office website.408-283-7500monday to friday 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.(icon at the bottom right corner)monday - friday, 9 a.m. - 12 noon and 2 - 4 p.m.bachelor's degrees and undergraduate admissions onlyjoin the queueto speak with us virtually!due to a high volume of emails currently, please expect delaysadmissions@sjsu.edustudent services center (ssc)one washington squaresan jos, ca 95192san jose state universityone washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0016san jose state universityone washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0017
