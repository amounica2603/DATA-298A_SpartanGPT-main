if you want to give the gift of communication as a human right for all and positively impact lives through a career in speech-language pathology or audiology, then you should major in communicative disorders and sciences (cds). california faces among the worst shortages in the nation of speech-language pathologists and audiologists. both these dynamic professions enjoy an excellent future outlook as noted on theamerican speech-language-hearing association website. speech-language pathologists identify, evaluate, and treat infants, children, youth, and adults with speech, language, hearing, cognitive-communication, and swallowing disorders and audiologists identify, diagnose, and treat persons with hearing and balance disorders.the requirements to apply to sjsu and the california state university system vary depending on whether you're applying as a freshman or transfer. for more information, visit the sjsu admissionsfreshman csu eligibility requirements webpageortransfer csu eligibility requirements webpage. additionally, to apply to cds:our coursework provides a foundation in speech, language, hearing sciences, and in foundational principles for assessing and treating persons with communication disorders.whereas the ba in communicative disorders and sciences forms the basis for future graduate-level coursework in speech-language pathology or in audiology, a ba degree in cds is not sufficient to work as a speech-language pathologist or an audiologist. state and national standards require a master's degree and completion of a clinical fellowship to practice as a speech-language pathologist, and a clinical doctoral degree (aud) to practice as an audiologist.view ourcourse roadmap [pdf]to successfully complete the course requirements
