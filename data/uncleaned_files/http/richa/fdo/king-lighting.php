may 3, 2010 - king library receivesin the lighting retrofit category!the king library lighting retrofit project was submitted to the ninth annual ca higher education sustainability conference 2010 and was chosen from submissions from the 23 csu campuses for the best practices in energy efficiency award in the lighting retrofit category.view the application [pdf]project highlights include:dr. martin luther king, jr. library was constructed as a partnership between the city of san jose, and sjsu and is operated by sjsu under a joint operating agreement.built in 2003 to leed silver standards (but never certified) the building was a pge savings by design project that was calculated to perform at 32% below the 1998 california title 24 minimum energy standards. sjsu is in the process of applying forleed certification as an existing building.in 2006 the campus determined the building was operating at 24% below title 24 and started a monitoring based commissioning (mbcx) project. in the course of the mbcx work, the campus reviewed the building's lighting fixture types and controls.among the findings of the mbcx project were mechanical system issues and lighting issues, including poor control of the layered lighting that resulted in higher energy usage. in addition, an incompatibility between bookstack t5ho lamps and instant start ballasts resulted in premature failure of lamps and ballasts driving the cost of lighting maintenance to $5,000 - $7,000 per month.a project to correct the mechanical issues resulted in 6.7% reduction in energy consumption and a lighting project resulted in an additional 22% reduction.located in:corporation yardoffice hours:monday - friday, 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.saturday and sunday, closed
