below are answers to regarding the eventual apartment complex including building amenities and leasing. for any questions or concerns not addressed here, emailworkforcehousing@sjsu.edu.as part of the market demand survey released and undertaken for alquist, a range of amenities for the project were explored and pitched to the campus community. this includes but is not limited to communal entertainment and kitchen space, pet facilities such as a dog run and grooming equipment, bike storage and maintenance. no specific commitments have been made at this time and will not be determined until the development team explores the feasibility of such amenities further along the process. the project planning team welcomes amenity recommendations as well as comments toworkforcehousing@sjsu.edu.decisions and processes regarding leasing and residency will be part of ongoing planning and discussions with community stakeholders. the university anticipates a separate property management company to handle any and all leasing matters.proposals and decisions on this matter will be considered for this project at future stages of development in consultation with the campus community and relevant stakeholders.safety for future residents remains a top priority for the university in developing this project. further activation of the area contributes to a vibrant streetscape and can help to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment.proposals and decisions on this matter will be considered for this project at future stages of development in consultation with the campus community and relevant stakeholders.this project may - when and if determined to be feasible by the selected development partner - create up to 1,000 units of apartments, subject to similar leasing standards and procedures of other housing complexes. families and pets will be welcome to share in residency, following similar guidelines and rules seen in other forms of rental housing.this project may - when and if determined to be feasible by the selected development partner - contain a number of on-site parking space, at an amount that will be determined further in the planning process. specific details on use, pricing, and availability will also be determined at a later stage.while this state property project is not subject to land use rules established and enforced by the city of san jos, as of 2022, parking requirements no longer apply to new development in the city. in alignment with sustainable land use, no such parking minimums, such as a set amount of car spaces per unit, would apply to this project.the demand survey undertaken by sjsu in fall 2022 also indicated a lower demand for on-site parking by interested respondents, underscoring the declining reliance of parking and car infrastructure by potential tenants. most interested survey respondents indicated that they would continue to use on-campus parking facilities for which they pay already should they live at the project. this lower demand for parking on-site reduces the total development cost which in turn means less potential rent charged to tenants.located in:corporation yardoffice hours:monday - friday, 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.saturday and sunday, closed
