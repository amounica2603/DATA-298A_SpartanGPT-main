i was a stay-at-home mom for 10 years, and when my youngest was nearing kindergarten age, i decided i wanted to go back to school to get a master's degree in library and information science so that i would actually be employable by the time both kids were in school.conveniently, there was a great mlis program right here in san jos, at san jos state! during my time as a student, i did two internships at the king library, which i really enjoyed. after i graduated in 2010, i started working in the library at foothill college, but about a year later, one of my former mentors from the sjsu library, tina peterson, emailed me that the library was hiring part-time librarians. i jumped at that opportunity because i loved the king library, the work sounded more interesting, and frankly, the commute was a lot shorter!i started working at the king library in february 2012, and just finished my ninth year there. i love working in the king library, and on the san jos state campus (i can't wait to be there in person again!), and have the greatest colleagues (we have a lot of fun!). san jos state truly transformed my life!
