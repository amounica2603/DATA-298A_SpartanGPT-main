to: studentsfrom: vincent del casino, jr., provost and senior vp for academic affairssjsu students,in the days since i shared an update regarding a working plan for fall 2020 teaching and learning that sjsu leadership is currently discussing, i have received questions about next semester. i appreciate the inquiries, and i wanted to provide some clarifications regarding the discussions.thefor the fall is that physical distancing requirements are lifted and we can return to as much face-to-face instruction as possible. given the uncertainty surrounding the covid-19 pandemic, especially in santa clara county, we also need to plan for alternative scenarios for the fall 2020 semester. the state of california and public health officials are indicating that practices, such as physical distancing requirements, will very likely remain in place into the fall.due to this, the campus wants to ensure maximum flexibility so that sjsu can adjust to any scenario it finds itself facing when the semester begins in august. we are exploring the possibility of moving large lecture classes online, while keeping labs, dance studios, art programs, research experiences, clinical opportunities and smaller classes in rooms that allow for enough space to keep everyone safe.some courses may already show as online for the fall in the schedule of classes as soon as this week (we can and will move these back to classrooms if permitted under public health guidelines). most everything else remains in the planning stage, and when decisions are made, updates will be sent to the campus community. we understand students are currently facing important decisions about housing, moving and class scheduling for the fall 2020 semester. we will have more options that address some of these concerns very soon. sjsu campus leadership is mindful of the stress students are under right now. we are working to create a plan that provides maximum flexibility and enables us to meet students wherever they are. no one will be without an option for an sjsu education this fall.thank you for your continued patience and perseverance during this truly unprecedented time. our students embody the spartan spirit, and we look forward to a day when we can all be gathered again on campus.sincerely,vincent del casino, jr.phone:408-924-2400email:provost@sjsu.educlark hall 552one washington squaresan jos, ca 95192-0020
