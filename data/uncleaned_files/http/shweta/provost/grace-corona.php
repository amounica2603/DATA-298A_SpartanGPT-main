political sciencecollege of social sciencesi chose political science as my major because i have always enjoyed being intellectually challenged through reading and writing. i wanted to understand the underlying mechanisms of how government works because i want to pursue a career in law.receiving this award means more to me than words can describe because i have been working towards this achievement since i started college. to me, this shows that my late night reading, writing essays, and studying without sleep have contributed to my bigger picture of success. moreover, it reinforces to me as a first generation student that all of my parents hard work is also paying off and that my obstacles have served as motivation.both my mom and dad have been the greatest influences i have had throughout my life. they embody fearlessness through every action they take and every plan they commit to. i have always worked towards being as fearless as they have been since they left mexico to come to the united states, basically starting all over again with little to no resources. thinking of their resilience and strength has always given me the power to have my own strength because through them and their accomplishments, i know it is possible to make your dreams come true. through my time at sjsu i have met a lot of amazing faculty, but in particular professor kenneth peter has been an amazing mentor. he has pushed me to try things i am afraid of and makes me aware of my strengths, and overall has helped me become the best student i could be.growing up as an undocumented student and individual stemmed a lot of obstacles in terms of being able to attend a four year university because of the little resources that existed for daca students when i applied to school. yet, being a daca recipient and being an undocumented person has served as my motivation to try harder and always do better. therefore, since this experience i have had since arriving in this country, it has shaped my ambition, drive, and work ethic.i would tell other students that every single thing that you can dream or put into words is possible, especially the harder and more difficult it sounds. what is important about achieving a goal like being on the presidents list is putting it out into the universe and making sure every move you make is part of contributing to this larger goal you have. also, i would tell other students to always remember your why, meaning to always have in the back of your head the main reason you are getting an education and why you want your degree. knowing your why will drive you strongly to achieve any of your dreams and goals. all in all, knowing that dedication and sacrifice is something to look forward to because you are one step closer to achieving your goals.what makes me a spartan is my endless fight to want to find equity for all students. ever since i stepped foot on sjsu campus and started taking in everything it has to offer, i began to understand all of the work that needs to be done for marginalized communities. my passion that i have developed through the amazing people who attend this university and ambiance the students create at sjsu, is unlike anywhere else i have been. therefore, what makes me a spartan is my ambition to fight for others and always strive to make my environment better than i left it.chair, political science"i would like to nominate patricia (grace) corona from political science. in addition to being a president's scholar, grace is an active member of our department and university community. she serves as an orientation leader (earning an a+ in the accompanying leadership course), and was recently accepted into the ucla law fellows program, which supports outstanding potential law school students from underrepresented backgrounds. as a first-generation college student who has personally suffered discrimination, grace has demonstrated the kind of courage and resilience combined with academic excellence that makes our students so remarkable."phone:408-924-2400email:provost@sjsu.educlark hall 552one washington squaresan jos, ca 95192-0020
