sent: august 2, 2021from: vincent j. del casino, jr., provost and senior vice president for academic affairsdear colleagues,i hope that everyone is doing well. the start of fall semester is coming up quickly and, as you know very well, covid continues to evolve. we will have a campus widetown hallnext monday where we will work through some of the questions that are emerging. we are in a week-by-week mode at this point, and as we begin to repopulate campus things will change.please read the messages that are coming from the president on issues related to, for example, new mask protocols. also, please note that it has an equipment list in case colleagues are planning on face-to-face teaching and they need microphones, etc. (https://sjsuequipment.getconnect2.com/).it is important to keep in mind that many people have children at home that cannot be vaccinated yet or might have or be taking care of a family member with a compromised immune system. i know wearing a mask is difficult. but we wear them to keep ourselves, our families, our coworkers, and their families safe.as we gradually begin our return back to campus this month ahead of the fall semester, we could have more changes.vaccination is a very important part of our campus safety. sjsu has partnered with santa clara county to host pop up vaccination clinics on campus. the clinics will be located in the student health center and are open to all faculty, staff and students from 12 - 7 p.m.registration is encouragedbut walk-ins are welcome.we have all worked so hard this past year and a half and i really appreciate each and every one of you! kudos to all the folks in university personnel, health and safety, the campus repopulation committee, and others who have also worked relentlessly to get us back to campus even as the rules of the game continue to change! and, thank you to the faculty, staff, and student workers in our division, who have really kept sjsu running!i ask that you please be kind and patient with one another. unfortunately, we still have a long way to go.sincerely,vinphone:408-924-2400email:provost@sjsu.educlark hall 552one washington squaresan jos, ca 95192-0020
