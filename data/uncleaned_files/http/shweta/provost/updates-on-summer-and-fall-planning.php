sent: february 24, 2021dear colleagues,i hope this email finds everyone well and safe. we are well into the spring semester and, for many of us, our courses remain remotely delivered and our office work is still operated largely through a parade of zoom-based meetings. for me, i have been both drained and relieved by remote work. drained, because i miss the day-to-day connection and energy that comes from interacting with colleagues and students on campus. relieved, because i know i have the privilege of remaining largely sequestered and relatively safe from the spread of covid-19. i dont take that privilege lightly; we all know people who live without that privilege who have suffered from this pandemic. there has been significant loss of life and a real impact on the ability, for some, to work after contracting covid-19. this, like all pandemics, is affecting different socioeconomic communities differentially. while covid-19 doesnt discriminate, the structures of support and access certainly do, even when operating without intent.as we enter march, i know that many of you are wondering what the summer and fall will bring. will i be working on campus? what about my classes? will they be face-to-face or remote? the campus leadership team is looking at many scenarios and options for summer and fall. in each and every conversation, the health, safety, and welfare of faculty, staff, and students comes first. i imagine you are thinking: what does this really mean, vin? it means we are planning with knowledge we have today, while trying to predict what it will look like five to six months from now. its an impossible, but required, task. given that uncertainty, here are a few points of reference that we currently know:if we are honest with ourselves, we know that covid-19 is not going away any time soon. it will likely circulate, hopefully at very low levels of infectivity, for years to come. we can, and will, fight against its spread but we have to be prepared for living in a world with covid-19 (or the next infectious disease). in living in a covid-19 world, we have to figure out how to bring back the option of face-to-face learning and on-campus co-curricular life. we will do that slowly this fall in a way that does the best we can to protect everyone, but we cant make any guarantees. the world is just too messy.in response to all that is going on, i want to hold another divisional town hall in march. this is an opportunity for us to collectively discuss our current and future approach to balancing safety and access. i look forward to this conversation.in the meantime, please do what you can to be safe and healthy. and, thank you for all your amazing work this year. i am so proud to be part of this community. even in the wake of this unbelievable pandemic everyone continues to give so much to our students and to each other. thank you.sincerely,vinphone:408-924-2400email:provost@sjsu.educlark hall 552one washington squaresan jos, ca 95192-0020
