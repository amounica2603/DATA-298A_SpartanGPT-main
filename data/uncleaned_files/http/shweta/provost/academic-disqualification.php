to: academic affairs divisionfrom: vincent j. del casino, jr., provost and senior vp of academic affairsdear colleagues,to mitigate the effects of the mid-semester changes in instructional modes as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we are implementing a temporary change to our academic disqualification policy.for spring 2020, academic disqualifications due to low gpa will not be processed at either the graduate or undergraduate level. instead, students will be placed on continued probation.however, if there is an approved request by a program or department for administrative disqualification, that will be processed according to the existing process defined in university policy.undergraduate students whose sjsu cumulative gpa falls below 2.0 and graduate students whose sjsu cumulative gpa falls below a 3.0 will be placed on academic probation as usual.we wanted to get this message in advance of a message to students, which will go out next week when they return to courses remotely.thanks,vinphone:408-924-2400email:provost@sjsu.educlark hall 552one washington squaresan jos, ca 95192-0020
