vibrancy.to bridge sjsu with the downtown san jos community,sjsu loves san joswas launched. this effort was originally planned to be a single in-person event held in conjunction with the weeks of welcome. however, given the pandemic, this effort was pivoted to an online website where new students could learn about their new home (i.e., culture, local businesses).additionally, the city joined in welcoming the students by lighting city hall, rotunda, and the san jos civic in blue and gold. events intended to activate those spaces during the lighting were planned but put on hold. the same

discounts.the san jos downtown association, team san jos, and the japantown business association through their online presence (e.g., email and social media) welcomed back the spartan community in
