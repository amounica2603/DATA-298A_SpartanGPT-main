my work is anchored in examining the sociology of higher education. my research centers on four core strands: (1) historicizing and contextualizing race-conscious affirmative action policies; (2) applying a critical analysis to framing and discourse as related to race-conscious policies, (3) promoting equity oriented critical policy analysis for praxis, and (4) interrogating first-generation-ness as a continuum, which includes examining the experiences of first-generation faculty.dr. mara ledesma was featured on a panel hosted by the ucla division of social sciences to discuss the context and implications of california proposition 16.dr.mara ledesmawas featured on a panel at stanford's race, inequality, and language in education (rile) conference during the fall 2020 semester. watch the full recording above - dr. ledesma begins speaking at36:42.listen to mara's playlist below and access all of the personality playlists on ourlurie college of education spotify accountsjsu connie l. lurie college of educationsweeney hall 103one washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0071create opportunities for lurie college students!
