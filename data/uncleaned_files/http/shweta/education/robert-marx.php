robert marxs community-engaged research and practice focus on reframing dominant visions of queer young people, so that they are no longer viewed as damaged or at-risk, but rather as the gifted, complex people they are. marx deploys a variety of research methods, including critical youth participatory action research and meta-analysis, to better understand and promote marginalized youths development. as a former high school english teacher, they approach this work from the intersection of educational studies, developmental psychology, and critical pedagogy, and his work encourages young people to see themselves as producers of knowledge and change agents.listen to robert's playlist below and access all of thepersonality playlists on ourlurie college of education spotify accountsjsu connie l. lurie college of educationsweeney hall 103one washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0071create opportunities for lurie college students!
