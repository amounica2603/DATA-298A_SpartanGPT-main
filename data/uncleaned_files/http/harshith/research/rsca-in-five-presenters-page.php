much of the research, scholarship, and creative activity on campus is designed to bring educational, economic, and social benefits to our local and global communities. here we invite talks that address any semiconductor production and supply, quantum technologies and their implications for our economy, and the development of a diverse science and engineering workforce.lunch will be served.join us on march 3, 2023 from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. as we explore these fields together., in mlk 225, in the king library.you may register for the event onour rsvp form.sjsu welcomes the following faculty who will be presenting their research.|david.parent@sjsu.educollege of engineering, department of electrical engineeringmpel 3.0 status update and future directiondavid parent is a professor in the electrical engineering department and current director of the multidisciplinary microscale engineering process laboratory (mpel) at san jos state university (sjsu). he introduced mosis to the ee department at sjsu where he has successfully designed, fabricated and verified integrated circuits such as alus, sram, plls, low power opamps, silicon neurons (quadratic integrate and fire), asynchronous adders, pixel level light to frequency converters, and subthreshold dsp filters. david has written numerous tutorials on ic design using cadence software tools, semiconductor process design using synopsys tcad tools, and board-level circuit design using ltspice. he has developed a four mask nmos process, four mask ldmos process, seven mask cmos process, a solar cell process, a hafnium oxide deposition process, and an organic semiconductor thin film process for use at sjsus microfabrication lab. his current research areas include ic design of qif neurons for ai applications and novel non-linear devices for ai applications. he received his ph.d. in electrical engineering in 1999 from the university of connecticut. he can be reached at david.parent@sjsu.edu.|hiuyung.wong@sjsu.educollege of engineering, department of electrical engineeringcryogenic semiconductor and quantum computinghiu yung wong is an associate professor and silicon valley amdt endowed chair in electrical engineering at san jos state university. he worked in the industry on semiconductor technologies for 12 years before joining san jos state university in 2018. he is the author of the book, "introduction to quantum computing: from a layperson to a programmer in 30 steps". his research interests include the application of machine learning in semiconductor simulation and manufacturing, cryogenic electronics, quantum computing algorithms, and noise modeling. his works have produced one book, one book chapter, more than 100 papers, and ten patents.|hilary.hurst@sjsu.educollege of science, department of physics & astronomyquantum state engineering with ultracold atomsdr. hilary hurst is an assistant professor in the department of physics & astronomy. she is a quantum educator and theoretical physicist, with broad interests in condensed matter theory, many-body atomic physics, and open quantum systems. her research primarily focuses on the theory of quantum noise and quantum measurement and feedback control for many-body quantum systems. in addition to research, dr. hurst is passionate about making quantum physics education more accessible and preparing students to work in the growing quantum technology industry. dr. hurst is originally from greeley, colorado and received her bs in engineering physics from the colorado school of mines. she went on to earn a masters in applied mathematics & theoretical physics at the university of cambridge (uk), and received her phd in theoretical condensed matter physics from the joint quantum institute at the university of maryland. following her doctoral work, she was a national research council postdoctoral fellow at nist in the quantum measurement division. dr. hurst joined the faculty of san jos state university in fall 2020.|abraham.wolcott@sjsu.educollege of science, department of chemistryprecision molecular and atomic chemistry of a diamond nanoprobeprof. abraham wolcott is a physical chemist who focuses on the surface chemistry of nanoscale and bulk materials for biological labeling and alternative energy productive (solar cell research).dr. wolcott is passionate about education and research, and as a physical chemist has found great pleasure in exploring nanomaterials for sustainable energy production, biological labeling and quantum sensing. abe has mentored 60students, many from underrepresented backgrounds and actively recruits talent through the black leadership and opportunity center in collaboration with director emerald green.|ahmad.shaar@sjsu.edulucas school of business, department of global innovation & leadershipwhere do we need quantum computing in the era of business intelligence?dr. shaar has been administering and teaching in higher education for over 22 years where he has always kept one foot in business innovation and it consulting. he founded four and co-founded six startups in his multidisciplinary career. in addition to being a technical program manager at google, dr. a. is chair of the mba & mscs programs at jessup university. he teaches project management, entrepreneurship management, knowledge management, global business dimensions, project quality & scope management and other courses with sjsu, uc berkeley, university of silicon valley, and jessup university. in addition to his three masters degrees (it/crm - mis, marketing, & hr) that he got from the american university of technology - lebanon, he received his executive mba in hospitality & tourism management from institute universitare kurt bosch - switzerland. dr. a. earned his doctorate from california southern university and had an abd from international technological university - california. his research about "business intelligence in agile project management" is registered at the us congress library. dr. a. has always been a big fan of showing the impacts of quantum computing on knowledge management and business intelligence. his projects with google, intel, youtube, starbucks, levi's, and other top 100 fortune companies showed heavy dependencies on big data which required supercomputing to process intelligence that supported decision making.|ozgur.keles@sjsu.educollege of engineering, department of chemical and materials engineeringautomatic discovery of quantum dot composites for structural composite batteriesdr. keles is the kordestani endowed chair and associate professor of chemical and materials engineering at san jos state university. he received his bs and ms degrees fromthe department of metallurgical and materials engineering at middle east technical university, and his ph.d. from the school of materials engineering at purdue university in 2013. hiscurrent research interests are additive manufacturing, nanocomposites, informatics, and engineering education, funded by nsf career, nsf mri, national endowment for the arts, and industrial partners. dr. keles was selected as the advisor of the year at san jos state university for his contributions to materials student clubs in 2019.
