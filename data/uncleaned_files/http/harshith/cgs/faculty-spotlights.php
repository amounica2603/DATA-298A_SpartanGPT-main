marie haverfield, college of social sciences"in spring 2020, i oversaw independent studies of three communication studies graduate students: anum ahmed, yesenia carrillo, and jasmine itliong. together we explored interview data from oncology patients, caregivers, and providers to understand experiences and preferences for communication during prognostic conversations. these graduate students learned how to develop their own coding scheme, apply that coding scheme, work with one another to ensure reliability across coding, and interpret the results. we are currently writing a paper based on our findings, of which all three students will be co-authors. an added bonus to this experience is that all three graduate students are women of color, advancing their own academic growth and enriching the field with their important perspectives. im thrilled to be in a role that affords me the opportunity to support this process and look forward to ongoing collaborations with my students."professor of meteorology and climate science to direct wildfire interdisciplinary research centersan jos state university has established the largest academic wildfire interdisciplinary research center (wirc) in the united states with five new tenure-track faculty members and millions of dollars in new technology. the purpose of the new center is to serve as the leading institution in california, providing modern, state-of-knowledge on wildfire science and management.professor of meteorology and climate science and director of the fire weather research lab craig clements will serve as director of this new center.sjsu asst. professor wins rona jaffe foundation 2019 writers awarddr. selena anderson, assistant professor in sjsu's creative writing program,was among six emerging female authors to be honored by the rona jaffe foundation in 2019. the recipients were chosen through a rigorous selection process conducted by a small committee of established writers who serve anonymously. the recipients this year received $40,000 each at a reception sept. 12 that was followed by a reading on sept 13 at new york universitys creative writing program reading series at the lillian vernon writers house.professor gitte mcdonald receives prestigious nsf career awardmoss landing marine laboratories is proud to announce that faculty member, dr. brigitte (gitte) mcdonald, has been awarded a career award from the national science foundation.the accidental geographer: a podcast with vincent del casino, sjsu provostsjsu provost vincent del casino's podcast highlights the expertise of the faculty at san jos state university, whose research, teaching, and commitments to community engagement bring life to this cutting-edge university. the "accidental geographer" is a play on words, an attempt to demonstrate that even for these accomplished scholars, life often creates opportunity out of the accident.listen to the podcast
