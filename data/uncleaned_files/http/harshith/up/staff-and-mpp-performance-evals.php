performance evaluations are important for all employees. the goal is to increase communication, establish clear expectations, reinforce good performance, improve unsatisfactory performance, and foster a spirit of cooperation and teamwork.receiving feedback throughout the year is equally important and should come in the form of one-on-ones with your manager, group meetings, etc. nothing in your probationary or annual evaluations should ever come as a surprise. it should be a summary of what occurred during the evaluation period.timelinesforms and resourcestimelinesforms and resourcesquestions? emailperformanceevaluation@sjsu.edu.university-personnel@sjsu.eduup north:408-924-2450up south:408-924-2250up webmasterup northadministration building 242up southupd building 3rd floor
