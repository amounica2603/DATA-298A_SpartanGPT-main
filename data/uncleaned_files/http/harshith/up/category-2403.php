this work type is restricted to full-time (t/tt and lecturer) faculty for unit 3 duties of a limited time, that are of a substantially different nature than their primary or normal employment. category 2403 appointments must meet the tests introduced inlimits on additional employment appointments.category 2403 may be used in summer, winter, and other breaks (only up to 1.0 ftef), but it may not be used for appointments traditionally made in summer classification categories 2357 and 2457 or other special session categories (e.g., 2322). employment in service to summer or special session programs is not appropriate for category 2403. departments must have a position number to appoint in the class code; it may be funded by general funds or non-general funds depending on the purpose of the appointment.examples: think, "appointment to perform duties," such as "emergency appointment;" replace a graduate coordinator on leave for part of a semester; acting department chair; teaching a required class no others could; program planning during summer break; summer rsca appointment; president's task force; 16th unit for full-time lecturers; and summer research for h-1b visa holders.payment: the appointment establishes automatic pay installments on the state's payroll calendar during the appointment period; category 2403 requires no payment vouchers. category 2403 has a unique pay scale, allowing deviation from base rate when appropriate and approved.category 2403 is a systemwide faculty classification (job) code. formally it is, class 2403: ft faculty unit - additional employment; abbreviated class title: ft fac-add em. compared with the "special consultant" classification, category 2403 simplifies additional employment appointments for university-approved--consistent with article 36 of the unit 3 cba--faculty-related duties. category 2403 is the new default appointment type for full-time faculty receiving overload or additional work that is not appropriate to summer, winter, or special sessions. special consultant requests for full-time faculty may be transferred to category 2403 by up - fs for review and appointment.to learn more about making this type of appointment inonbase, please visit:category 2403 guide.a full description of the work to be done is required. think, "appointment for duties," not appointment to complete a project. duties are assumed to be completed as assigned, so follow-up information is not required like with special consultant appointments.payment for work is typically by monthly rate (not less than current appointment). the time duration is used to calculate monthly payments, with prorated rates when partial months are appointed. category 2403 has its own pay schedule, so when justified, compensation may exceed the full-time monthly rate.given the constraints imposed by article 36 of the cba, the funding sources for category 2403 will be a mix of stateside funding and non-general funds. when the department requests the appointment and it is approved, if the department needs a position number linked with 2403, one will have to be requested.to avoid errors, check that:if approved, up - fs will route to up-employee support services (ess) for processing. ess will then forward to payroll.once payroll processes the payment, separate checks will be issued after each monthly pay day. faculty will automatically receive payment for the duration of the appointment. no payment requests need to be submitted.up - fs may slightly inflate the monthly payment in order to avoid a settlement payment.a teaching assignment over 15 wtus is allowed when following the order of work as defined in the order of assignment (12.29 (a) or 12.29 (b)), the appointment is either:necessary to meet a temporary faculty employees entitlement to full-time work;orto offer work to a part-time temporary faculty employee up to full time under provision 12.29 (a) (8) or (b) (9)typically, teaching overload of this nature is compensated by workload reduction in a future semester (banking time). the current appointment would be at 15 wtus, but a future appointment would be higher by the amount of the current overload.however, if the faculty member, the dean, and up - fs approves, faculty may be compensated for the overload under cba provision 36.5(d). in such cases, an additional appointment reflecting the overload is processed as category 2403.submit a category 2403 request for any work beyond 15 wtus, appointing the excess into category 2403. currently, these requests for 16th unit appointment are submitted to employee support services with other hiring paperwork. ess will work with up-fs to review requests.at times, schedule adjustments may not help departments avoid appointing a t/tt or full-time lecturer faculty member to teach an extra class with overload compensation. this appointment type is permitted only when the solutions below are impractical, or likely detrimental or disruptive to department operations (avoiding overload). solutions to avoid overload include:requests for overload teaching for t/tt and lecturer faculty appointments are submitted as category 2403 in onbase. the justification should include explanation for taking the unusual step of appointing a faculty member to teach in overload status.university-personnel@sjsu.eduup north:408-924-2450up south:408-924-2250up webmasterup northadministration building 242up southupd building 3rd floor
