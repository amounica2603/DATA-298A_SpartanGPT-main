this project involves ecampus working with faculty members to incorporate virtual reality/augmented reality into a course during the semester. this project supports faculty members in the following ways:aerospace studieslearning objective/outcome:for this project, the participant will interact with a counselee in an immersive environment. the participant will view a scenario and then react to the scenario verbally and non verbally or choose an option that best describes their desired response. based on the participants reactions or choice, the scenario would change and the participant would get immediate feedback from their actions or choices.geographylearning objective/outcome:this project is looking at relating geographical information in a 3d/virtual environment. through the combination of mapping data and 3d modeling, the information can transform from static to immersive. this project will provide students with a "hands-on" environment. the technology currently getting used is arcgis 360 vr.nursinglearning objective/outcome:the project is looking to develop an immersive experience that combines the anatomy of the heart alongside a variety of ecg patterns. the project invoices the development of this activity for a virtual reality environment. technology currently getting used is unity.sociology and interdisciplinary social scienceslearning objective/outcome:for this vr storytelling project, students design a virtual environment that tells the story of people and events in asian american history. students will draw from multidisciplinary research, evaluate social science information, draw on different points of view, identify and conceptualize how dynamics of ethnic, cultural, gender/sexual, age, class, regional, national, transnational, and global identities impact people, and demonstrate a knowledge of how us political institutions work.chemistry and science educationlearning objective/outcome:the ar/vr science project aims to prepare future science teacher to be technology innovators in their classrooms and create new learning opportunities to enhance student success with virtual reality. the teacher candidates will explore virtual reality app on ipad along with htc vive and google cardboard to interact with interactive 3d science models in a direct and engaging way. they will be able to create, publish and share interactive presentations with vr content creator for their lessons. incorporating ipad and vr equipment in the science education course creates new opportunities for teacher candidates making new connections to the science concept and encourages students to ask more questions and take charge of their learning.occupational therapylearning objective/outcome:occupational therapy students must learn to evaluate the home environment for potential obstacles to performance and safety, and develop recommendations and intervention plans for clients. the virtual home will ensure that every student will encounter predetermined barriers to independent living and participation. the project combines kinesthetic, visual, and verbal learning in an active learning situation. class discussion about problems encountered in the virtual home should promote pragmatic and collaborative reasoning abilities.engineering mechanicslearning objective/outcome:introductory, fundamental engineering mechanics courses, such as statics, mechanics of materials, dynamics, and mechanics of fluids, have far too long been focused on intense mathematical and theoretical concepts. my research proposes to provide a virtual reality gamification platform for these difficult concepts which will take students through expeditions in a near-future world after a major earthquake hits california. they will learn strenuous concepts, which in my opinion require more than just lecturing in mastering them. my goal is tospark students curiosity into a burning flame in engineering.phone:408-924-2337email:ecampus@sjsu.edulocation: irc, room 206ecampus, irc206instructional resource centersan jose state universityone washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0026
