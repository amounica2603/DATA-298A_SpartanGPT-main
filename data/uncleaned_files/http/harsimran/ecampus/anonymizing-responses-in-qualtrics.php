this guide will help familiarize you with the process of anonymizing your responses.anonymizing your responses is an effective way to permanently scrub a response of identifying information before saving it in the data.when responses are gathered with the anonymous link, enabling this setting will remove the respondents ip address and location data from your results. when responses are gathered with the individual link, enabling this setting will remove the ip address and location data and disconnect the response from the contact who provided it. in this way, you can know which contacts have responded (through your distribution history and contact history), but not which response belongs to which contact.once a response has been anonymized, the scrubbed information cannot be restored.1. open survey options from the survey module.2. select the anonymize response checkbox.phone:408-924-2337email:ecampus@sjsu.edulocation: irc, room 206ecampus, irc206instructional resource centersan jose state universityone washington squaresan jose, ca 95192-0026
