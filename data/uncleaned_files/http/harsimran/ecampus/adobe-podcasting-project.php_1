in collaboration with adobe, ecampus and the center for faculty development, sjsu faculty share their experiences from the sharing voices: a podcasting project. read their reflections and view some recordings of their program presentation at the adobe digital literacy day.this fall 2021 semester made me aware that time management skills are essential in the creation and development of a podcast. thankfully, while teaching 6-graduate units as a lecturer with the school of information, it appears that my time ran away from me and i was not able to launch my podcast as i had intended. klaus trilck was very helpful during our summer one-on-one and with our future email communication exchanges. i intend to complete the development of my future podcast during the winter break and launch it for the spring 2022 semester. the handouts that trilck provided are a great resource to remind me of the numerous resources that exist that will support the creation and development of the podcast. essentially, my goal is to make up for my scheduled completion of the podcast project during this winter break.the podcasting program was a great way to get my feet wet with having students produce a new type of media in my course. i love students to produce products and this is a creative way for students to work on a mini concept in my course and demonstrate their understanding. by having my students create a 1-3 minute podcast i was able to quickly grade their understanding of the mini concept and create a library of primary source analysis for the whole class to access. i look forward to doing more with digital media in my online class.cristina siegel, environmental studiesimplementing a podcast project into my envs10 classes was both rewarding and challenging, with positive end results for both students and me as the instructor. i had many initial concerns about providing an enriching experience that engaged students in the course material, while still providing all the normal class content as well as teaching about podcast creation, which was so new to me. however, i believe providing a solid structure to the assignment and making it a semester long project provided the time and flexibility we all needed. my students were struggling just being back on campus and with the past year+ of covid change and i wondered if this project was too much. it turned out to be semester highlight. they created really solid, if not perfect podcasts, with some creative flair that was fantastic. they were most challenged by the editing process and software and struggled with group project dynamics, yet they all got through it. their final presentation day blew me away; they conducted good interviews and created interesting, well-done podcasts with visuals. we hope to use parts of these interviews on our department website. overall, i believe the process and rubrics developed worked well. for future podcast projects, i would want to rethink and adapt how to share/teach adobe audition. also, interviewing our department faculty is not feasible on an ongoing basis, so i would need to consider different interview or presentation options. overall, i am truly grateful to have participated in this program and feel it was a success. students engaged, environmental issues explored, and 11 terrific podcasts made!kathleen normington, film and theatrethis has been a challenge but i learned so much and want to do it again with another group of students. i chose to have the students create podcasts which involved a lot of preparation on my part. only after their 15 -20 minute podcasts were created did i realize what needs to be adjusted next time. the students seemed to appreciate the opportunity to learn podcasting techniques and were especially excited to interview the guest playwrights. there are definitely aspects of the assignment that i will adjust but it was an incredible learning experience for me and my students!presentation recording: building community and skills with podcastinga look at how one class used podcasting to strengthen writing, research, planning, interview, and collaboration skills.esperanza huerta espinosa, accounting and financethis was my first experience creating a podcast and teaching about podcasting. i, as my students, started from zero, learning new vocabulary and a new technology. in the futureprobably during the summerim planning to create a repository for my students in which they can learn the basics of podcasting. it will probably be a stand-alone mini course that students can complete asynchronously, similar to those in linkedin. the mini course will not focus on the technology, as there are plenty of videos on how to use adobe audition, but more on vocabulary and podcast elements and structure. in this way, i will be able to reuse the mini-course in any class that i want to incorporate podcasting."presentation recording: sympathetic ears: students podcastingthis presentation describes how students created podcasts to give advice to other students.steven silver, marketing and business analyticsbefore the program, i had only passing experience with podcasts. i now will be working with them in the course. a continuing challenge in a required statistics course for students who have limited interest in statistics is to communicate assignments and why it is to their benefit to complete the assignments. the viewing of posted content is limited. i can assess this since the instruction in the posting are often not followed in the assignment.podcasts provide an opportunity to further engage students in addition to the outgoing podcasts, i will be requiring students to turn in sections of the assignments in podcasts. so, there will be a continuing exchange of podcasts. the program encouraged the use of podcasts and reviewed the methodologies to construct them. my goal for subsequent podcasts is to build more variation in media and content used in podcast so as to increase engagement by students.ruth rosenblum, nursingi really enjoyed this project. i learned so much about podcast editing, etc, though each time i produced one it was like starting over.....i was 'blown away' by my students' podcasts. some were just ok - talking for 10-12 minutes about a topic, but some were exceptional! the interviews! the music! the production! it was truly amazing. students claimed it took a lot of time (i agree) and that a typical discussion board entry would have been faster, but they really enjoyed producing and listening to their peers 'casts. one student stated that she enjoyed it so much that she is going to start her own podcast!it was a really fun and interesting way to produce scholarly activity, though time consuming -- probably equal to writing and editing a scholarly article.presentation recording: podcast nuts and bolts: how the rn right now! podcast was developedthis presentation describes the podcast series and assignment requirements for a graduate class, based on the adobe digital literacy podcast project.steven lin, music and dancethanks to the cfd for putting this workshop on. as a musician, the idea of podcasting is a very natural extension of my work, since i have lots of experience with microphones, recording, and editing. the technical side was never an issue. on top of that, i have a wide network of professional classical guitarists and musicians that i can rope in to converse with. but i needed one little push to get me to actually realize my podcasting ideas, and this workshop was it. i also didn't understand how to set up an rss feed, but spotify has made it so easy that it really took about 5 minutes to sort out on spotify. finally, what's really great is how much innovation there has been in the podcasting space. the call in app is a great example of social podcasting made easy and has completely reduced the friction to content production to the point where the content has the most potential to shine through. i remember the days of large recording studios, microphones that cost several thousands of dollars, all kinds of stands and cables and boxes and mixers, plus the professionals required to run them. just about all of that is gone now, and i'm grateful for it.presentation recording: my network is my contenta professional guitarist's take on bringing concert artists and international competitions into the classroom.emily wughalter, kinesiologyfor every program i have participated in through ecampus for 6 or more years i learn new technologies that assist me in teaching students at sjsu. specifically through the sharing voices program, i learned adobe audition and how to use it at a fairly novice level though i can cut and paste for editing, and i know how to upload to sound cloud for listening. i use camtasia often and sometimes tried to associate the ideas contained in video and audio only production as similar. i really enjoyed listening to the videos of the faculty participants. i am amazed at the creativity and ideas that our faculty implement in their teaching methodologies. i am glad i took the time to learn these new tools and also to be able to incorporate them into my classes both as a listening device and as an assignment device.phone:408-924-2337email:ecampus@sjsu.edulocation: irc, room 206ecampus, irc206instructional resource centersan jose state
