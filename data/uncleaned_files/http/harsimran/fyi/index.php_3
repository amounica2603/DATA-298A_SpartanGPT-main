recently, sjsu was notified by a vendor that products used at college of professional & global education tabling events held on the paseo on april 5 and may 4 are subject to a recall notice. the product subject to the recall is a jif to go peanut butter package (1.5 ounces). while we believe that we have directly contacted all persons who visited the college of professional & global education booth at these events, we also felt it prudent to personally notify the campus community of the jif recall. the vendor has advised that, in cooperation with the fda, they were voluntarily recalling this item, along with other products, due to potential salmonella contamination. you can find information concerning the recall at this link.we also would like to assure the campus community that we have reviewed records containing other food purchases made by the campus by its dining and food service vendors and have been assured that no further products listed as part of the jif recall have been in use by the campus.should you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact me via email attraci.ferdolage@sjsu.edu.
