leadership"this presentation explores queer filipinx leadership through the nonprofit organization, lead filipino. in 2020, lead filipino launched their inaugural lakbay summit. lakbay summit was born out of a need for lbgtq+ filipina/o/x services and programs to exist in the south bay area. since its inception, lakbay summit, run by lead filipinos queermitteehas created a community site of art, storytelling, mentorship, and action.the theme of lakbay was inspired by the work of omehra sigahne and trinidad escobar. both sigahne and escobar teach us that lakbay in tagalog, is a journey you take away from your usual environment to reflect, explore, and better understand yourself. lakbay has a special relationship with the word, bakla meaning gay or effeminate in tagalog. yet, bakla represents the inward journey to wholeness where you find that you are complete within yourself.the presentation will explain leadership development within lead filipino, and the importance of decolonization work in community organizing.sophia lamonica; sjsu student, school of information"transforming communities by advancing health equity"health equity is the attainment of the highest level of health possible for all people. achieving health equity requires valuing everyone with focused and ongoing societal efforts to address avoidable inequalities, historical and contemporary injustices, and the elimination of health disparities and health care disparities.central to advancing health equity is a consideration of language, and the narratives that shape collective thinking. regulatory bodies, such as the accreditation council for graduate medical education and its counterparts, maintain training standards regarding professional communication, internal biases, and nondiscrimination. although these guidelines describe and affirm the importance of non-stigmatizing, patient-centered language, as more institutions begin to share electronic records, a broader shift may be necessary to catalyze evolution in the language of health care.health equity narratives are developed from collectively recognizing and denouncing oppression in all its forms; they make visible not only the injustice, but the varied voices of the oppressed, and their perspectives on social justice. this presentation offers an introduction to shifting away from established, dominant narratives, and towards a health equity narrative grounded in a social justice framework that will serve to redistribute power and resources to those most in need."silicon valley council of nonprofits

capacities for personal and collective healing. individually, in pairs, and as a group, participants will explore breathing, visualization, and basic movement patterns, including rocking, humming, and

member and maria noel fernandez, parent & silicon valley rising campaign directorcoming soonin june of 2022, a shooting occurred inside of a library in east san jose in the presence of children, community and library staff. families heartbroken and angered by mass shootings across the country and gun violence in our neighborhoods said, "enough!" and came together to affirm the sacredness of our children, uplift our community and affirm that we cannot answer violence with violence. this event is a continuation of this conversation and a continued demand to invest in the communities most impacted by violence in ways that do not center police violence as a response to violence in the community and that do not deepen racial inequities and racial injustice.black and brown communities are disproportionately harmed by the police and by the police's response to reported crime. research has found that black people are more likely to be victims of violent crime in general while crimes against black and latinx people are less likely to be solved. black residents are also seven times more likely to be wrongfully convicted of a crime and latinx immigrants often fear reporting a crime they have experienced. latinos are killed by police at nearly double the rate of white residents and in california are 44 percent more likely to be perceived as armed by police. black people are still more likely to be killed by the police than any other group. from protests over the murder of george floyd, to breonna taylor, from andres guardado to uvalde texas, communities across the country have demanded a change. we know more police does not equal more safety. we know the over-policing of black and brown communities does not lead to better outcomes. how do we secure safety without centering policing? how do we achieve safety for all in ways that don't further harm, marginalize and traumatize black and brown communities? if not the police, then who?join us for this conversation on the policies and actions we can take to co-create safety. join us as we learn in community about what actually keeps us safe and the ways we can achieve safety together through improving our social conditions, centering our relationships and commitment to racial justice.asian law alliancerichard konda, director, asian law alliance and aram james, former santa clara county public defender"when

centers around racial justice as one of the major themes by addressing the systemic inequalities relating to race and ethnicity relating to housing. san jose has a rich and vibrant diversity of ethnicities, being home to large populations of latino, black, and asian ethnic groups. increasing renting prices, that far exceed family incomes, are driving communities out to bring in corporations and individuals with no interest in san joses rich history and diversity. evictions are one of the methods that landlords use to push tenets out. our proposed solution is to ensure that everyone facing eviction court has free legal representation.sjsu special libraries association student chapter (slasc)tina kremzner-hsing,sjsu student, masters of library scienceadriana poo, senior librarian

information science community who work on diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) initiatives. the acronym is ubiquitous, but we hope to ground the abstract goals of dei in concrete terms by asking professionals with practical experience how they approach these issues. we have invited the sjsu king library's anti-racist assessment working group to speak with library students (and anyone else who is interested!) about local initiatives towards identifying and addressing areas in our libraries that need greater diversity, inclusivity, equity and access.the description of the working group is as follows: "the death of george floyd jr. and national black lives matter protests prompted a few sjsu library employees to strongly encourage the library administration to act and address issues of race and racism within the organization. as a result, in the summer of 2020, the university library began a series of training sessions provided by deetta jones and associates to consult and assist in addressing issues of racism. furthermore, the sjsu library administration polled library employees to assess the priority of addressing policies and practices, resulting in the creation of the anti-racism assessment working group (arawg). the goal of the working group is to advance the anti-racism action plan's action items."indian health center of santa clara valley, santa clara county,
