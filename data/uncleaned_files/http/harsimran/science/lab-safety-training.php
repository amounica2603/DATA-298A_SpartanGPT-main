instructors or course coordinators of teaching laboratories and principal investigators (pis) of research laboratories are responsible for obtaining the appropriate safety permission (e.g., institutional biosafety committee (ibc) biological use authorization (bua) approval), generating the appropriate safety protocols (e.g., standard operating procedures (sops)), and assigning or conducting and documenting student and laboratory personnel safety training.please note that appropriate safety and training documents must be completed before beginning experiments in a laboratory. safety and training documentation must be maintained in a binder in the laboratory, which is referred to below as the laboratory safety binder (except in the case of chemical safety training for students in the chemistry department, which is stored electronically by the college of science safety team and the chemistry department office (see below).information on the sjsu and college of science (cos) procedures designed to meet federal, state, county and csu safety requirements in the following areas is below:remember that biology laboratories usually use chemicals, and geology laboratories sometimes use chemicals and/or power tools, so read all relevant areas of safety below for your experiments.safety and training documents will be checked by thecos safety teamat the regular bi-annual safety audits.: many experiments conducted in teaching and research laboratories require submission and approval of a bua to the ibc before experiments begin. please see thesjsu ibc bua websitefor more information. if your course or research lab involves the following activities or agents, you must submit a bua:for bsl1 experiments, students in teaching and research laboratories and laboratory personnel must:in addition, for research laboratories, laboratory-specific training must be provided by the pi, and must include:: appropriate decontamination materials must be available in each research laboratory, (usually bleach and/or 70% ethanol, which can be requested from the cos safety team).: a tall cylinder containing dc gold for decontamination of serological pipettes and a small metal bucket for small glass pasteur pipettes is required if these are used in the laboratory. biology faculty can request the containers and dc gold from matt voisinet at in the msc. working strength (3%) dc gold may be disposed of in the sink, however higher concentrations must be collected as hazardous waste and disposed of in properly labeled chemical waste containers provided by the cos safety team.: the following documentation must be included in the safety training binder for both teaching and research laboratories:: all bsl2 experiments conducted in teaching and research laboratories require submission and approval of a bua to the ibc before experiments begin. please see thesjsu ibc bua websitefor more information.for bsl2 experiments, student in teaching or research laboratories and laboratory personnel must:research laboratory-specific training must be provided by the pi, and must include:: the following documentation must be included in the safety training binder for research and teaching laboratories:: use of chemicals in several hazard classes requires the development and use of standard operating procedures (sops), as per thesjsu chemical hygiene plan [pdf].. chemicals sops should be submitted to thecos safety officeto review for completion.chemical sop acknowledgement signature pages must be signed by all students and personnel and submitted to the cos safety team via thischemical sop signature page submission google formbefore chemicals are used in a teaching or research laboratory. research labs must submit chemical sop signature pages at the beginning of each semester or any time there is a significant update to the sop. teaching labs must submit chemical sop signature pages at least one week prior to the use of the chemical in that lab.sops must be developed for especially hazardous procedures, including working with:eh&s has developed aguidance document [pdf]for developing chemical sops that includes links to a list of many chemicals in each of these hazard classes.a single sop for each hazard class in a research laboratory is sufficient. template documents for sops for each of these groups of chemicals, and more information on chemical sops is available in the chemical & laboratory safety section of theenvironmental health and safety (eh&s) lab safety webpage.if you would like additional support in developing an sop, please contact thecos safety office.: the cos safety office provides a cos chemical safety training for tas, students and research personnel in all research laboratories that use chemicals. students must review the cos chemical safety training slides. students in chemistry department research laboratories must take a chemical safety quiz from the cos safety office, and training records are available from thecos safety team. chemistry department research students can request to take the quiz usingthis form. please contact kitty nguyen atngoc-huong.nguyen@sjsu.eduin the cos safety office with any questions. students in any other department in the cos document their training by signing a signature page in the laboratory safety binder (see below).research laboratory-specific training by the pi must include:attn: pis name, dh 435129 s. 10th streetsan jose, ca 95112-3619the cos safety team barcodes all chemicals that are received and delivers them to research laboratories. when a chemical container is empty, remove the barcoded label from the container and place it on the laminated sheet in the chemical container collection bucket, which is provided by the cos safety team to each laboratory. then place the empty chemical container in the bucket. if you accidentally receive any chemicals directly, please contact the cos safety team so that they can pick up the chemical to barcode it and return it to you.an awareness-level training for students and research personnel in research laboratories may be developed by instructors, course coordinators or pis for student researchers and laboratory personnel who will not themselves conduct hazardous procedures, but will work in a laboratory where hazardous procedures are conducted. this training must also be documented (see below).for teaching laboratories (e.g., general or organic chemistry lab), the specific hazards of chemicals to be used by students shall be discussed on a day-to-day basis. this discussion shall include the proper safety controls (e.g., engineering controls, work practices) and personal protective equipment used to prevent exposure and proper management of hazardous wastes generated.for research laboratories, the following documentation must be included in the laboratory safety binder:: all students and laboratory personnel in rooms with class 3b or 4 lasers or laser systems (exception: permanent class 1 systems containing a class 3b or 4 laser) must receive laser safety training.as per thesjsu laser safety plan [pdf], laser training at sjsu consists of two parts:: the following documentation of both general and lab and laser-specific training must be included in the safety training binder:1. for general laser training, either:2. lab and laser-specific training, either:: training on the power tools must be developed by instructors, course coordinators or pis for the power tools that are in their work area. this training should include a review of the safety manual for each piece of equipment being used. the hand and power tool training on csu learn can also be used for general training.: documentation of safety training must be included in the safety training binder. it should consist of printed out slides and/or text bullet-points outlining the power tool safety training, followed by a signature page that the person who provided the training and student researchers and laboratory personnel who received the training must sign and date to indicate that they have read and understand the safety training. the trainer can initial by each trainees signature. a printout of the certificate of completion from the csu learn hand and power tool training can also be included.for techniques that are outside the scope of what is described above, please contactrandy.kirchner@sjsu.edufor referral to the appropriate resource.phone: 408-924-4800email:science-info@sjsu.edugive to the sciences fund
