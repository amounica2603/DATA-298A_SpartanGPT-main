sent: december 9, 2022from: interim president steve perezfellow spartans,as we close our fall semester at san jos state university, we would all love to be able to say that the impacts of covid-19 are behind us. unfortunately, that is not the case. covid-19, as well as flu and other respiratory illnesses, are taking hold and we need to continue to be vigilant in protecting ourselves and others.based on the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc)metrics, covid-19 cases and related hospitalizations in santa clara county are currently at a high level. we have moved from low to high over the course of one week, signifying an acceleration of community transmission.we will communicate to the campus community again before the start of the spring semester to provide an update on metrics and the associated campus safety measures.we continue to align campus safety measures with cdc community level metrics. as community metrics change, so do the safety measures. see ourhealth advisoriespage for more information.additionally, sjsu will continue to adhere to required safety measures from the california department of public health and the santa clara county public health department.signage around campus includes qr codes that outline current campus masking status. please check that status frequently while on campus as we are in a dynamic place with transmission due to the winter as well as holiday breaks.students must continue to comply with thecsu vaccination policyandsjsu presidential directive 012022 [pdf]. employees are also required to comply with thecsu vaccination policy. this policy requires that students, faculty and staff remain current on boosters for which they are eligible.starting in spring 2023, required testing for asymptomatic, unvaccinated individuals will end, regardless of the cdc community level. optional, free, pcr testing for asymptomatic faculty, staff, and students will remain available on demand in the student wellness center and student union throughvending machines.as in past semesters, individuals experiencing covid-19 symptoms are encouraged to stay home, schedule a test with their provider, and follow their guidance regarding quarantine or isolation based on the test outcome. symptomatic students may schedule an appointment with a student wellness center provider to be tested. employees should consult with university personnel regarding appropriate guidance and options for sick time and/or leave:yazmin perez (yazmin.perez@sjsu.edu, 408-924-2155)elizabeth munoz (elizabeth.munoz1@sjsu.edu, 408-924-2148)melanie nguyen (melanie.nguyen@sjsu.edu, 408-924-2243)sjsu standards for quarantine for close contacts and isolation for positive cases will continue in line withsanta clara county guidance [pdf]. isolation in university housing will operate with an isolation-in-place model, prioritizing the allocation of isolation spaces for situations involving cases or roommates with high-risk health concerns.our overall approach essentially remains the same, based first and foremost on the care, health, and well-being of our campus community. as the situation continues to change and evolve, well adjust and modify our approach, as well as campus protocols and practices. well continue to communicate whenever there are changes to our policies and approaches. thank you, as always, for your flexibility and willingness to adapt.thank you,steve perezinterim presidentemail:healthadvisories@sjsu.edusign up for alert sjsu
