: july 22, 2021: president mary a. papaziandear campus community,the covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve, with the delta variant quickly becoming the dominant strain in the united states. because the variant is highly transmissible, today,santa clara county joined two other bay area countiesin strongly urging employers to consider implementing covid-19 policies that require employees to be fully vaccinated as soon as possible. this update, along with thecountys announcement last weekrecommending everyone, regardless of vaccination status, wear masks indoors in public places comes as the delta variant is causing a spike in covid-19 cases.there are a few exceptions where individuals not fully vaccinated are not required to wear a mask: 1) alone in a vehicle when conducting a university-sponsored activity; 2) alone in a private office with the door closed; 3) if the work you are conducting cannot be achieved safely with a mask in place; or 4) if an individual has an approved accommodation. individuals who are not vaccinated and who do not have a private space indoors to take breaks or eat should do so outside.these changes are fluid as we respond to an ever-changing public health crisis. with many staff members returning gradually to sjsu this month and more fully for fall semester beginning monday, august 2, it is important to note this mask policy can change again. if there are changes or updates, we will update the campus community.the increase in covid-19 cases throughout the country and the threat of the delta variant serve as a reminder that we are still navigating this pandemic. sjsu continues to strongly recommend the campus community get vaccinated before the fall semester begins.sjsu has partnered with santa clara county to host pop up vaccination clinics on campus. the clinics will be located in the student health center and are open to all faculty, staff and students from 12 - 7 p.m. the pfizer-biontech (2-dose) and johnson & johnson (1-dose) vaccines will be available at these clinics.registration is encouragedand currently available for august 4. walk-ins are welcome.santa clara county also is hosting another pop up clinic this friday, july 23 at lvl up arcade located at 409 south second street. the clinic will be open from 9 a.m. - 1 p.m. and is open to anyone over the age of 12. no appointment is necessary and walk-ins are welcome.thank you for your continued patience, flexibility and kindness to one another during this pandemic as we continue to keep the health and safety of our spartan community as our highest priority.sincerely,dr. mary a. papazianpresidentemail:healthadvisories@sjsu.edusign up for alert sjsu
