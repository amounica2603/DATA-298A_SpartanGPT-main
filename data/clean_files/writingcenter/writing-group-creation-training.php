writing in college can be long, lonely, and challenging! many student writers can feel burned out. one of the most effective remedies for these feelings is to participate in a writing group with other students.a writing group is a supportive community of like-minded writers who form a group to offer mutual support, ideas, and accountability. working with other student writers creates a safe space to ask questions, troubleshoot issues, and discuss any fears.this virtual training is for everyone who wants to learn how to set up and run their own successful writing group. this training will explain the benefits, discuss best practices, and share tools for four different kinds of peer writing groups: support groups, work groups, feedback groups, and hybrid groups.we are offering this training three times this semester. each training covers the same material, so you only need to attend one.click on your preferred date from below to register for the zoom session.
