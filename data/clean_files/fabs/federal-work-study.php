federal work study(fws) funds are allocated to sjsu for the purpose of hiring students with qualifying financial needs. the funds provided to your department will cover only a part of the student's salary.if your department hires a work study student, you will need to match the federal funds with a smaller percentage. typically it is 25% to 30% of the total salary. departments are responsible for any amount their work study students earn above the fws award amount.if a student has expended more than the award amount, you can reclassify fws salaries as student assistant (sa) salaries. to do this, please submit ahr expense adjustment request to a financial aid accountant in accounting services.if an adjustment is required to move sa salaries into fws salaries, then verify the fws award eligibility of the student with the financial aid & scholarship office. once confirmed, you can submit ahr expense adjustment request to a financial aid accountant in accounting services to reclassify the salary.off-campus agencies and auxiliary organizations may also hire work study students. we require a deposit at the beginning of the fiscal year. accounting services will send you monthly statements showing the balance remaining in the fund.phone: 408-924-1558 email: financeconnect@sjsu.edu finance and business services san jose state university 60 south market street suite 470 san jose, ca 95113
