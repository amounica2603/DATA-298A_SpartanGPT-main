the u.s. department of education (doe) and the california student aid commission (csac) selects federal aid applications for verification. in addition, the doe or san jose state university (sjsu) may select a student for verification if the information submitted appears to be incorrect.if you have been selected for the process called verification, sjsu will be comparing information from your fafsa with your (and your spouse's, if you are married) and/or your parent's income tax return, or with w-2 forms, or other financial documents. federal regulations state we have the right to ask you for this information before awarding federal aid.students selected for verification will have required documents assigned in their to-do list in mysjsu. submit the required documents as soon as possible to avoid delays in processing financial aid and to meet the registration tuition fee deferral deadlines. staff will work to review verifications within 4-6 weeks after submission, but during peak times this may not always be possible. it is the student's responsibility to provide documentation in a timely manner so that deadlines can be met.below is a list of all acceptable documentation and forms used:if there are differences between your application information and your financial documents, the financial aid and scholarship office will need to make corrections electronically. since corrections may take some time to process, we encourage all students to submit the appropriate documents in a timely manner. while your correction is being processed, your file is considered incomplete, and funds will not be awarded.the financial aid and scholarship office relies on the u.s. department of education to notify students via email that verification changes are complete; in this email, doe advises students that a corrected institutional student information record (isir) is available for review on the fafsa on the web website.if the student wishes, he or she may check with the financial aid and scholarship office and see how verification affected his/her expected family contribution (efc). the change will be reflected in the award amounts (if any) on the award letter.award notifications are posted within mysjsu after all issues related to verification and any other eligibility issues are resolved.email: fao@sjsu.edu phone:408-283-7500 ext 4 monday to friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. live chat tuesday to friday 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. virtual appointments friday from 10:00 a.m - 3:00 p.m. in-person appointments monday to thursday 8:15 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. student services center (ssc) 9 street & san fernando (on 1 floor of north parking garage)financial aid and scholarship office san jose state university one washington square san jose, ca 95192-0036
