Students who are not on active status may purchase student parking permits through the university's student services office. students who misrepresent themselves as current or active may revoke their parking privilege, reporting to student affairs, and purchasing a new permit through the campus's official ticketing system. If more than one person finds a vehicle without paying for additional permits, both of them will be citationd for misuse of the permit. customers can change their vehicle information at any time during the day or night. all student-commuter virtual permits are sold through the SJU ParkMobile App or self-serve permit pay stations.
