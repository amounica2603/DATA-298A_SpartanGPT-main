San Jose State University's employees can now purchase employee parking permits at a reduced rate. If they aren't paying the regular rate, they can buy a "virtual permit," which is a form of paper that allows an employee to purchase a specific number of days, weeks, or months of space on a per-tax-deduction basis. These virtual permits are valid for all types of spaces and areas. For example, students living in their dormitory can pay $7.00 per month to go to the south 7th street garage. They can also get special "o' parking" privileges through their department head.
