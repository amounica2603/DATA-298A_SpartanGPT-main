parkmobile is an app that allows people to pay for their next-to-nothing in-person or over-the-air. It's easy to set up an account and make a payment. If you're not a regular parker, it's a good idea to check out the full-fledged version of the app. The only drawback is that you can't use the same account on both the app and the web. So, if you've never used either of these two services before, you might want to start over again.
