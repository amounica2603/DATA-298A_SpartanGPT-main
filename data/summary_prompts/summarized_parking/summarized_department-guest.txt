On-Campus Visitor Permits During the weekdays and during the evenings, there are limited amounts of on-campus space for guests to park. To request a permit, they must submit a completed request form with information about the event being held, the date of the event, and the amount of the fee. If changes are made after the time of the request, additional charges may be charged.
